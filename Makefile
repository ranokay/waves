# so 15.0 is the default; CI's legacy macOS legs overlay pyside6 6.9.3 and
# override this to 12.0 via the environment (hence ?=) for the "_legacy"
# bundles. The value is declared in Info.plist so an unsupported system shows
# a clear "requires macOS N" dialog instead of a silent Dock bounce, and CI's
# "Assert macOS version floor" step fails any build containing a file that
# demands something newer than the flavor's declared floor.
