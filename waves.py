"""Packaged-build entry point for the Waves QML UI.

This is the compile target for a standalone Waves build (the binary that ships
in the public repo's Releases). It is a thin launcher, deliberately separate
from ``waves/waves_ui/app.py``: Nuitka compiles the entry file as ``__main__``,
so it must use *absolute* imports, ``waves_ui`` keeps its relative imports and
stays a normal package, untouched.

This file lives at the repo root, NOT inside the package: as ``waves/waves.py``
it would shadow the ``waves`` package for its own absolute imports, and Nuitka
names the build artifacts (``dist/waves.app`` / ``dist/waves.dist``) after this
file's basename, which the build and CI key on, so neither its name nor its
location may change casually.

From a source checkout, ``python -m waves.waves_ui`` remains the way to run;
this file exists so ``tools/build_waves.sh`` (task ``build``) can produce the frozen app.

The ``nuitka-project`` directives below are the canonical build recipe. They
target the QML front-end: the PySide6 plugin pulls
in Qt's QML runtime, and the bundled ``qml/`` and ``fonts/`` directories ride
along as data files so ``app.py`` finds them next to itself at runtime.

# Qt 6.11 added a Qt.labs.assetdownloader QML module that ships ONLY as a

# plugin scan rather than the DLL list, so --noinclude-dlls does not reach
# it; tools/build_waves.sh prunes it from the build virtualenv beforehand
# instead (tools/prune_static_qml_plugins.py).
# Drop the heavy Qt modules Waves never loads, it is a QtQuick app that only
# imports QtQuick(.Controls.Basic/.Layouts/.Effects/.Shapes/.Dialogs) + QtCore.
# NOTE: on a macOS standalone build Nuitka names the Qt libraries without the
# "libQt6" prefix (e.g. "QtWebEngineCore"), so the patterns must match the bare
# module name, "libQt6WebEngine*" matches nothing here. By far the biggest win
