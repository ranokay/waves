"""A merge member is gated against the folder the engine will really write to.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
A best-of-both merge borrows the higher-quality copy of each song and writes it
into one assembled album folder. A member (``waves_identity_id`` set) may skip
only when the copy already on disk sits in THIS job's destination folder,
otherwise the skip leaves a hole in the merged album while the job reports done.

"THIS job's destination folder" was computed twice. The engine picks it with
``_keep_existing_layout``, which writes into an older folder spelling whenever
one already exists on disk (the pre-0.1.17 doubled-space name, or a name kept
from before an illegal-character setting changed), and it guesses the file
extension, which the Windows path cap can turn into a different parent folder.
The bridge re-derived the folder from the template with none of that: one tidy
spelling, a hardcoded ``.x`` where the extension goes. On a fresh library the
two agreed; on a library with any legacy spelling they diverged, so
``_owned_at_destination`` compared the ownership record against the wrong
folder, returned False, and the ownership verdict (the whole upgrade the run
was for) was thrown away. The album reported complete, every song was still the
old copy, and the merge plan was gone so a retry could not recover it.

The fix removes the second derivation: the bridge asks the engine
(``Download._destination_path``) the same question the write asks, with the
same placement (quality and list position) ``item()`` was called with.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
Real ``tidalapi.Track``/``Album``, a real ``Download`` with a real temp library
on disk, and the real ``_TrackedDownload`` gate as an unbound method. The
legacy folder is really created on disk so ``_keep_existing_layout`` really
diverts into it, and the test asserts the engine's own write target and the
gate's target are the SAME path, not two hand-written strings.
