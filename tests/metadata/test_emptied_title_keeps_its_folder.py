"""A title made only of illegal characters still gets its own folder.

XXXTENTACION's album is called "?", which every filesystem rejects outright:
the whole title sanitizes to "", the empty path segment is dropped, and the
album has no folder of its own. The stand-in setting cures that ("?" becomes
"-"), but the layout guard that keeps an existing library from being
restructured read the OLD spelling's folder, which in this shape is the artist
folder one level up. An artist folder exists as soon as the first track lands,
so the guard fired on every following track and the album's tracks scattered
loose into the artist folder (issue #16).

An ancestor existing is no evidence of anything. Only a file already sitting
in the old place is, and only for itself: it stays where it is (nothing on
disk ever moves), while everything not downloaded yet gets the folder.
