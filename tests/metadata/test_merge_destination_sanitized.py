"""A merge member owned in a folder the sanitizer RENAMED still counts as owned.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
A best-of-both merge member (``waves_identity_id`` set) may skip, or be forced
into an upgrade, only when the copy already on disk sits in THIS job's
destination folder. Two things have to agree for that check to ever fire:

* the ownership record stores the path ``item()`` actually WROTE, and the write
  runs every candidate through ``path_file_sanitize(candidate, adapt=True)``
  (``Download._destination_path``): a folder component over the 255-byte
  filesystem cap is truncated, control characters become ``_``, and on Windows
  reserved names, trailing dots and the 260 MAX_PATH cap rewrite it further;
* the gate (``_owned_at_destination`` / ``_destination_dir``) recomputes the
  destination folder for the same member and compares the two parents.

Since cf29d1f the gate asks the engine's own ``_destination_path``, so today
they agree. Nothing pinned it: a scratch mutation that dropped the sanitize
half of the destination decision survived the whole suite, because every
existing fixture used a folder name the sanitizer leaves alone. With the
sanitizer out of the gate's half, a record for a folder the sanitizer really
rewrites (a 300-character album title under the default ``[{album_year}]
{album_title}`` folder shape) compares against the untruncated spelling, the
verdict is thrown away, and the merge re-fetches (or the upgrade is lost) for
every song in that album, forever.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The "path the write produced" is NOT taken from the engine (that would be a
tautology under the very mutation this guards against): it is rebuilt from
the write's own recipe, ``format_path_media`` then ``path_file_sanitize``, and
a premise test proves that recipe differs from the plain template output. The
gate is the real ``_TrackedDownload`` code on a stand-in built without the
engine's network-touching ``__init__``, on a real temp library.
