"""Regression tests for the audited WavesBridge (backend.py) fixes.

Hermetic and Qt-free: constructing a real ``WavesBridge`` needs a Qt app, a
tidalapi session and (historically) a synchronous token-login network call, none
of which belong in a unit test. Each ``WavesBridge`` method under test here is
plain Python once its Qt signals are stubbed, so we bind the *real, unbound*
method onto a minimal ``_Stub`` carrying exactly the attributes that method
touches (fake signals record their emits). This exercises the shipped code path
without a running event loop.

Covered findings:
  * cancelQueueItem must NOT globally release the pause gate (finding 3)
  * clearQueue must abort every removed non-running item (finding 4)
  * logout must bump the library generation (finding 5)
  * best-of-both merge plan is kept on failure, dropped on success (finding 10)
  * loadMoreLibrary keeps a category scrollable after a transient error (12)
  * _restore_ffmpeg_path clears an injected path but keeps a user override (2/8)
