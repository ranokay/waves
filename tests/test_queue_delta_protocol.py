"""The queue tells QML what changed, and builds one job at a time.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF (issue #30's lag half)
-------------------------------------------
Two designs that each cost O(queue) for O(1) of news, measured with the
stress harness (scratchpad/queue_stress) before the change:

* Every row mutation emitted the WHOLE queue (queueChanged), and QML
  reconciled every row against the copy: 19 ms per change at 9,000 rows, and
  a worker thread emitting snapshots faster than the window absorbed them
  left a full copy of the queue in every queued signal (13 GB of growth
  while a blocked account failed 2,000 queued albums). Now a mutation marks
  its qids dirty and one GUI-thread flush emits three delta signals carrying
  only the rows concerned; queueChanged remains for the rare full resync.

* Every queued row was born holding its whole job: a Download object, a rich
  Progress, a relay QObject and a pooled Worker (about 19 KB apiece), with
  the 500 ms track poll walking all of them. Now a queued row waits as a
  _JobSpec and _pump_queue builds the job when the pool is free, in queue
  order: one Worker alive at a time however long the backlog.
