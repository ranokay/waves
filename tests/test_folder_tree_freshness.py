"""The cached folder tree must stay authoritative, and stay paired with its sweep.

TWO BUGS FENCED OFF HERE
-----------------------
1. A rate-limited sweep returns what it managed to walk (``tree.partial``).
   That partial tree used to be cached as authoritative, which made the
   unwalked folders (and every playlist inside them) vanish from My Tidal and
   resolved ``{folder_path}`` to "" for them, so their downloads landed outside
   their folder, silently, past skip_existing.

2. The playlists page interleaves folder rows with playlists BY INDEX
   (``full[i - len(folder_rows)]``). ``len(folder_rows)`` was re-read from the
   live tree on every page call while page 1 stayed cached, so any change in
   the root-folder count between two page fetches shifted the window and
   skipped a playlist with no error and no visible gap. The tree is now
   returned alongside the listing it was swept with, and the mixes tab (which
   has no use for the tree, and whose walk was the thing most likely to trip a
   rate limit) no longer re-walks it at all.
