"""Final-audit regressions for the self-updater and the bundle size report.

Five defects, all of them about what the updater does to files it did not
create: a backup kept BECAUSE it held the user's own files, and then reclaimed
by the next update; a staged single-file swap no launch could resume; a Windows
pid handed out twice; a build's own dropped files counted as the user's; and an
install that reported a version it had not staged. Plus one build-script
pipeline that failed the whole build once the bundle grew.

The real platform swap targets the live executable, so the same rules as
``test_updater.py`` apply: the apply paths are driven directly against a
tmp_path install, and the Windows helpers are asserted as script text.
