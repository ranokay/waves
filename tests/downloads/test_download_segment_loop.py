"""Regression guard: the segment-download loop must terminate.

THE BUG
-------
``Download._download_segments`` used ``while not self.progress.tasks[p_task].finished:``
and re-submitted every segment URL each pass, exiting only when the rich progress
task's ``completed >= total``. Progress advances once per streamed chunk. A segment
that returns HTTP 200 with an empty (0-byte) body yields no chunks, so it advances
the bar zero times; the task never reaches ``total`` and the loop re-downloaded the
whole track forever (an infinite spin, multiplying bandwidth and CPU). The single-
file path carried the same risk when a HEAD content-length overstated the bytes
actually streamed.

THE FIX runs the segment pass exactly once (segment-level retries already live
inside ``_download_segment`` via requests ``Retry(total=5)``), derives success from
the per-segment results, and snaps the progress bar to complete on success so the
GUI still reads 100% despite the short estimate.
