"""A formatted media path can never escape the download folder.

THE BUG
-------
``format_path_media`` substitutes each token blind. A token whose value
sanitizes to ``""`` therefore leaves an **empty path component**, and both
default templates open with ``{artist_name}``:

    "{artist_name}/[{album_year}] {album_title}/..."  ->  "/[2024] Album/..."

``Path(path_base) / file_name_relative`` DISCARDS ``path_base`` when the
right-hand operand is absolute. On Windows ``PureWindowsPath`` keeps the drive,
so the track landed at ``C:\\[2024] Album\\...``, outside the download folder,
and the queue reported done. On macOS/Linux the write failed at the volume root
with ``OSError errno 30`` and no explanation.

Artist names that empty out under pathvalidate's UNIVERSAL platform are real:
``?``, ``??``, ``*``, ``<>``, ``|``, ``"``, and names of only dots (trailing
dots are stripped). ``!!!`` and ``M|A|R|R|S`` survive, so this is about the
degenerate cases, not punctuation generally.

``_no_traversal`` fences ``..`` escaping the base and does not address this
shape; there was no ``lstrip`` and no containment check anywhere.

THE FIX drops empty components from the formatted relative path, which keeps it
relative (and therefore inside the base) and also tidies the doubled separator
an emptied mid-template token leaves behind.
