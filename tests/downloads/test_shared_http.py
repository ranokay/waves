"""The segment-download HTTP session is process-wide (Download._shared_http):
a per-instance session meant a cold connection pool for every queued album, so
each album start paid its TLS setup all at once (an all-core CPU spike per
click of Download, worst on modest Windows boxes).

Two properties keep that spike gone and must not regress:

1. Every connection shares ONE preloaded SSLContext. requests' default
   cert_verify hands urllib3 a CA bundle path per connection, which makes
   urllib3 build a fresh SSLContext and re-parse the whole certifi corpus on
   every TLS connect. _SharedContextAdapter suppresses that path.
2. The pool is small and blocking (pool_block=True, _HTTP_POOL_MAXSIZE), so a
   cold start opens at most _HTTP_POOL_MAXSIZE connections concurrently no
   matter how many segment worker threads are running.
