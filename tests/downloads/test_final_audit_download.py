"""The final pre-release pass over waves/download.py, one guard per finding.

Three defects, all of them silent in their own way: a run that writes a second
copy of a track it already has, a run that paints a finished playlist red, and a
rate-limit pause that quietly stops holding the run back. Each test states the
user-visible sequence it prevents, and each was checked against the unfixed code
first: reverting its fix turns the test red.

  1  the late skip only recognised a twin tagged on the BASE name, so a twin at
     a numbered variant, and a twin whose file carries no id at all, each got a
     byte-identical second copy that nothing ever removes
  2  the loser of two in-flight twins was refused at the move and reported as a
     FAILED track, over a file sitting correctly on disk
  3  two batch pauses in force at once: the first to wake reopened the gate for
     everybody, so the run went back to full API traffic mid-pause

Three more guards came out of reading the round itself, each one a hole the
round opened: the refused move logged a twin's step-aside in the words of a lost
download, the exhausted-name path still failed an item whose own twin held the
last name, and the counted pause bound every worker except the one that took it.
