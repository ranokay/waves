"""Regression guard: the collection-download loop must terminate.

THE BUG
-------
``Download._execute_collection_downloads`` used ``while not progress.finished:``
and re-submitted every item in the collection on each pass. ``progress`` is the
shared rich ``Progress`` bar, and ``rich.Progress.finished`` is
``all(task.finished)`` over EVERY task on it, including the one task
``_setup_progress`` adds per track. A track task is snapped complete only on
success, so a single failed track left the whole item list being re-submitted
forever: the album never finished, the queue row stayed "running", and with
skip_existing off every sibling track was re-downloaded and rewritten on every
pass, without bound. Only Cancel escaped.

The spin is specific to the single-URL (BTS) branch, which is the default
quality: multi-segment tracks advance their task even on failure, so they reach
completed >= total regardless.

THE FIX gates the loop on THIS collection's own progress task, which
``_process_download_futures`` advances once per completed item, so the pass runs
exactly once. This is the collection-level twin of the segment-level spin already
fenced by ``test_download_segment_loop.py``.
