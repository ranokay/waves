"""The download queue runs ONE item at a time, strictly in queue order.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
dl_pool used to run downloads_concurrent_max queue items side by side, which
read as the queue jumping around (livetest report): a 21-track album ground
along (its tracks carry the 3-5s anti-hammer delay and shared the
10-connection HTTP pool with every concurrent sibling) while single tracks
queued after it zipped past. The queue's promise is order; parallelism lives
inside a collection (the engine's per-collection track executor, still sized
by downloads_concurrent_max, which it reads live from settings on each run).

So two things must hold:
1. dl_pool is created with exactly one thread, regardless of the setting.
2. Saving settings must NOT resize dl_pool back up (the old live-reapply).
