"""The download queue runs ONE item at a time, strictly in queue order.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Parallelism belongs inside a collection (the engine's per-collection track
executor, sized by downloads_concurrent_max, which it reads live from settings
on each run), never to the queue: a 21-track album whose tracks carry the 3-5s
anti-hammer delay and share the 10-connection HTTP pool must not be overtaken
by single tracks queued after it. The queue's promise is order.

So two things must hold:
1. dl_pool is created with exactly one thread, regardless of the setting.
2. Saving settings must NOT resize dl_pool back up.
