"""HLS playlists must never be fetched by m3u8's DefaultHTTPClient.

m3u8.load()'s built-in client fetches with urllib and a bare
ssl.create_default_context(), which trusts only the interpreter's compiled-in
OpenSSL default paths. Those paths exist on the dev machine (Homebrew's
cert.pem) but not inside a packaged build on an end-user system, so every
playlist fetch failed TLS verification there. In the player that failure was
swallowed into the master-playlist fallback: the quality label stuck on AUTO,
the resolution menu did nothing, Qt picked a low variant (awful picture), and
seeking the multi-variant master restarted playback from zero.

The rule these tests pin down: every playlist fetch goes through a
requests+certifi session (RequestsClient / the pooled probe session), which
carries its own CA bundle on every platform.
