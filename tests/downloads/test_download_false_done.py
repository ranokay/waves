"""Regression guard for the false-"done" download bug.

THE BUG
-------
The download engine (``Download.item``) returns ``(False, path)`` WITHOUT raising
when it cannot fetch a stream URL, e.g. an unentitled/free TIDAL account whose
playback requests are rejected. The job worker used to discard that return and
emit ``downloadState(id, "done")`` whenever no exception propagated, so the UI
button flipped to a green DONE/check even though nothing was written.

THE FIX rests on ``_TrackedDownload`` tallying only tracks that actually wrote a
file (``ok_count``) and re-emitting the per-track ``failed`` status, so the job
worker can tell a silent failure from success. These tests pin that mechanism:
a ``(False, ...)`` item must NOT count as a success and must report ``failed``.
