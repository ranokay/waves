"""A failed re-fetch must not strand a discography group at "running".

_refetch_for_download is the fallback when a download is requested for an id
whose live object was evicted from _objs (a new search clears every bucket; a
discography video scan can even fill a whole bucket by itself, evicting its
own earliest members). When that re-fetch fails, the item never enters the
queue, yet its id stays in the artist group's key set. Without a "failed"
bump on the failure exits, len(done) can never reach len(keys): the artist
button spins forever and the group dict leaks for the session.

These tests bind the REAL _refetch_for_download and the real group bump
helpers over an inline pool, and require both failure exits (fetch failed,
and account switched mid-fetch) to settle the group.
