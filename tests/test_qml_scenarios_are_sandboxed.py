"""An offscreen scenario must never run against the real config directory.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
A scenario that builds a real ``WavesBridge`` inherits whatever config
directory the environment points at, and on a developer's machine that is
the packaged app's own: ``~/Library/Application Support/Waves`` (or the
platform equivalent). The bridge then adopts the user's settings, writes
its startup lines and tracebacks into the user's ``waves_dev.log``, and,
if a library root is configured, starts a REAL scan of the user's music
library from its constructor.

Three scenarios were missing the sandbox, and it showed: a verbose log
kept for a livetest was interleaved with test sessions, each one starting
a library scan that bailed seconds later, and a test's own "live TIDAL API
disabled in this test" traceback was written into it as an app ERROR.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
Every test module that constructs a bridge behind a QML engine either runs
its child through ``support.qml.run_scenario`` (which hands it a private
``XDG_CONFIG_HOME``) or sets that variable on its own subprocess env.
``path_config_base()`` honours the variable first on every platform, so a
scenario given one can only ever touch a temporary directory.
