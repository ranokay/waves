"""A Dolby Atmos release is its own row, wearing ATMOS, beside its stereo edition.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
TIDAL ships Atmos as a SEPARATE release with its own id, every track of it
Atmos-only, listed under the same title as the stereo edition (sometimes with a
"(Dolby Atmos)" suffix, sometimes not). Both stages of Waves' duplicate handling
group by title, so the Atmos edition met its stereo twin in one group and,
ranking as the tier TIDAL reports for its container, either lost the collapse
(the Atmos row silently vanished) or won it (the stereo edition was replaced by
a spatial one for someone who never asked). Either way one of two real releases
never reached the screen.

And when an Atmos-only row DID reach the screen it wore the tier its container
would carry if there were a stereo stream, LOSSLESS usually, which promised a
file it could never deliver.

THE RULE, decided 2026-08-18
----------------------------
* An Atmos-only release or track keys apart from its stereo edition in EVERY
  same-release grouping (the always-on dedup and the opt-in edition collapse),
  so both rows survive. Two rows, never two badges: the Atmos setting decides
  which one you download, not which one you may see.
* Its quality label is the word ATMOS. The pill draws that as an outline with a
  filled dot and SPATIAL for a spec, in plain ink, off the ranked ladder.
* A stereo edition, and a rare single id that carries BOTH modes, key and label
  exactly as before: the kind is "Atmos and nothing else", never "has Atmos".
