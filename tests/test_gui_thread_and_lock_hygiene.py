"""Network work must not run on the GUI thread, nor under a held lock.

THE BUGS
--------
1. ``previewArtist`` and ``downloadArtist`` called ``_get_artist`` in the
   **slot body**. A QML-to-slot call is a synchronous call on the GUI thread,
   and on an ``_objs`` miss ``_get_artist`` issues ``session.artist(...)``,
   which reaches tidalapi's request layer. tidalapi passes no ``timeout``
   anywhere and its session is a bare ``requests.Session``, so the window froze
   for the length of that request. Every sibling (``previewMedia``,
   ``_refetch_for_download``, ``loadArtist``) resolves inside ``work()``. The
   codebase already knew the hazard: ``_try_token_login``'s docstring records a
   synchronous login on the GUI thread hanging the app at launch.

   Misses are ordinary, not exotic: every fresh search clears all ``_objs``
   buckets, and a cache-hit re-search re-emits the payload without repopulating
   them, so any artist card shown from a cached search has no live object.

2. ``_browse_fetch`` held the process-wide, non-reentrant ``_browse_lock``
   across that same untimed request. Only tidalapi's shared page parser needs
   serializing; the request does not. A wedged peer therefore blocked every
   other acquirer, including ``_refetch_for_download``, and because all
   acquirers sit on the shared UI pool, a few blocked workers saturate it and
   take search and artist pages down with Browse.

These are structural guards: they assert *where* the call sits, because the
failure is a freeze, which a functional test cannot observe without hanging.
