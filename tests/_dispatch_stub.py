"""Arm a partial WavesBridge stand-in with the queue dispatcher's state.

_download used to build a job per call and hand it straight to dl_pool; it
now records a _JobSpec and _pump_queue builds the job when the pool is free,
one at a time (the backlog resilience work for issue #30). Stubs that bind
the real _download therefore need the dispatcher's fields, and their inline
pools keep their synchronous behavior through a _jobFinished stand-in that
calls the real _on_job_finished directly: the Worker's finally emits it, the
next queued spec starts, and a multi-download test still sees every job run
in order within the _download call it drove.
