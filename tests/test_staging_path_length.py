"""The whole staging path is capped, not just its name (issue #17).

The sanitizer bounds a FINAL path against the platform cap (260 on Windows)
and the staging name against the 255-byte component cap, but nobody budgeted
the 42 characters of staging decoration against the whole-path cap. A final
path that fit Windows' limit by less than that put every staging attempt past
MAX_PATH, the OS answered "no such file or directory", every retry failed
identically, and exactly the longest-named tracks of an album were lost (3 of
13 on the reported album). Only the throwaway readable part of the staging
name may shrink; the final name is never touched.
