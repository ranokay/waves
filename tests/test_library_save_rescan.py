"""SAVE CHANGES starts a library scan only when a library setting really moved.

The Settings page deliberately keeps its edit map populated after a save (so the
controls go on showing the values that just landed, instead of reverting to the
now-stale schema defaults), and it only clears on the next open. So every save
after the first one in a single visit resubmits the library keys unchanged.
applySettings used to test whether those keys were PRESENT, which turned every
later save (of any setting at all) into another sweep of the user's library: on a
cold network share that is a slow walk of the whole tree, and it restarted the
card's scan readout for nothing.

Tested with the method-bound stub pattern (no display, no live bridge), the same
shape test_quality_change_live.py uses.
