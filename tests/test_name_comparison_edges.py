"""Two names that are one file to the filesystem have to read as one to us.

The in-flight claim set, and the numbered-copy scan that reads it, compared
paths as exact strings. A filesystem does not: macOS and Windows fold case, and
a name typed as NFC (the API's spelling) is the same file as the NFD spelling a
tool that came from HFS+ wrote. Two tracks differing only that way therefore
each read the other's name as free, both claimed it, and the second finished
download was refused at the move with the occupied-destination error, so it
never reached the library.

Names on disk are untouched by all of this: only the comparison is folded. What
is written stays exactly what the template produced, or an existing library
would be spelled one way and looked up another (which is issue #16's mechanism).
