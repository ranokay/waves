"""A clean cut and its explicit twin never merge into each other.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The edition key strips the [Explicit] / [Clean] marker on purpose, so a clean
cut and its explicit twin always land in one edition group. Neither may borrow
from the other: a clean preference must never be handed an explicit recording,
and an explicit preference keeps its own cut of a song rather than trading it
for a clean one that happens to be the better file.

That much the matcher already refused. What it could not do was tell the twin
apart from a genuinely different tracklist: the unmatched tracks made the
group fail the superset guard, so the whole group declined with "not_superset"
and TWO EDITIONS THAT ALIGNED PERFECTLY LOST THEIR MERGE because a third,
the clean twin, was standing in the group.

The group is now split before planning. What is pinned here:

* the split happens on the songs the editions really disagree about, proved by
  the merge matcher itself, never on a release-wide flag. The earlier attempt
  partitioned on that flag and broke: tidalapi defaults an album's explicit to
  True and a track's to False, and an "explicit" release with no profanity on
  it is byte-identical to its clean twin. An untouched group must plan exactly
  as it did before;
* two explicit editions still merge with a clean twin in the group;
* the losing side is never a source: no borrowed track ever crosses;
* the discography path picks the side from the preference, and with BOTH asked
  for the losing side is still downloaded whole rather than dropped;
* the single-album path picks the side of the album that was CLICKED, whatever
  the preference says, and says so when it declines.
