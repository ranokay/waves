"""Building a page of search rows asks the bridge about presence ONCE per badge.

THE COST THIS FENCES OFF
------------------------
libraryAlbumPresence is a QML -> Python crossing, measured at ~22us a call
(the matcher itself is only ~4us of that; the rest is the boundary). The pill
and the Download button each used to carry the album's identity as FOUR
properties, so filling one in fired four change handlers and a fifth from
Component.onCompleted, and each of those asked the same question again: 15
calls per album row, 750 for a 50-row page, about 16ms of GUI thread spent
re-answering during a page build.

The identity is now ONE object property, so it is one binding evaluation and
one call. This pins the budget rather than the exact number, because the
number legitimately moves when rows gain or lose a badge; what must not come
back is the per-property fan-out.

The TRACK side pays the same crossing (libraryTrackPresence) with the same
one-object-identity shape, so its budget is pinned here too, additively and
separately: album fan-out and track fan-out regress independently. A track row
has TWO consumers of that answer, the pill beside the title and the download
button's claim face, and both are counted, so the budget stays "one call per
thing that asks" rather than one per row.

The ARTIST rollup (artistLibraryPresence) is the third axis, and it has the
same two consumers per card: the badge strip on the cover and the card's
Download button, which is coloured by what the rollup found. Counted the same
way, for the same reason.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
