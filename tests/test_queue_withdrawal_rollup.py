"""Withdrawn queue rows settle their rollups, and stranded rollups self-heal
(issue #32).

The defect: every path that credits a discography/folder rollup lives inside a
download worker, and every path that WITHDRAWS a row (CLEAR ALL, the Queued
section's CLEAR, a row's cancel or remove) only dropped the row and its spec.
A queued member withdrawn that way could never enter the group's ``done`` set,
so ``finished`` never came true, the group was never deleted, and every later
tick re-emitted ``running`` under the artist id. The QML holder map is reset
by value only, and after a clear the drawer's STOP (the one control that
sweeps groups) is hidden with the queue empty, so the button was stuck for
the session: "the progress bar remains and the discovery cannot be downloaded
again" until a restart.

Fixes pinned here, layer by layer: the withdrawal slots credit never-started
rows to their rollups; _reap_stranded_groups deletes any group with no live
member row (two consecutive sightings, so a group mid-birth is never eaten);
the bumps drop their emits when a STOP moved the scan generation under them;
a stale batch enqueue is refused by its generation; and _download refuses an
exact duplicate of a row already queued or running.

Same hermetic pattern as the queue's other tests: the real unbound methods
bound onto a minimal stub, no Qt app or network session.
