"""STOP sticks even when it lands while the folder is being probed.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
A job checks its abort gate once, as its worker picks it up, and then runs the
reachability probe of the download folder. That probe is the slow part of
starting a job: against a stale network mount (an SMB share this app's users
live on) it costs seconds, remounts, and probes again. Nothing looked at the
abort gate afterwards.

So STOP pressed in that window marked the row cancelled, cleared the button
and said "Downloads stopped", and then the job came out of the probe and set
the very same row back to running: the button re-lit at 0% and the status line
read "Downloading ..." again, for as long as it took to enumerate the whole
collection (much longer under rate limiting). Only then did the job notice the
abort and fall back to Stopped. To the user, STOP simply did not stick.

The job now looks at the gate again on the way out of the probe and settles
exactly as it does when the abort was already set on the way in.
