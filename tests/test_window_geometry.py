"""Tests for window-geometry persistence in the bridge (issue #6).

Two layers are covered:

  * ``_fit_frame`` (the pure screen-clamp helper) exercised directly with
    synthetic screen layouts, so the "keep the window reachable" math is checked
    without a display, and
  * the ``windowSaveGeometry`` / ``windowRestoreGeometry`` round trip through a
    real ``waves.json`` on disk, exercised through a Qt-free stub that binds the
    real bridge methods onto a plain object (same approach as
    tests/test_ownership_bridge.py). The screen clamp is stubbed to identity in
    the round-trip layer so it does not depend on a real screen; the clamp math
    is covered on its own above.

Like tests/test_ownership_bridge.py these import WavesBridge, so they collect
only in the full runtime venv (PySide6 present).
