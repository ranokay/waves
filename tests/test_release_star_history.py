"""A release must not blank the star-history chart.

The chart image and the README block that shows it are produced ON the public
repo by star-history.yml and exist nowhere in the private tree. release.sh
publishes a verbatim snapshot of that tree, so every release deleted both, and
the published README carried an empty "Star History" section until the
workflow's next 06:00 UTC run. Every release reopened that window.

release.sh now copies both off the public tip before publishing. Refreshing the
chart is still the workflow's job; the release simply stops undoing it.

The scenario builds a throwaway repo with a fake "public" remote and runs the
real release.sh in RELEASE_DRY_RUN mode, which stops after building the tree,
before any prompt or push.

release.sh itself is the maintainer's private release tool (untracked on
purpose -- see the .gitignore note: it publishes the tree of a ref, so a
stray `git add -A` can never sweep it into a commit). On any checkout without
it these tests cannot run and say so, instead of failing like a regression.
