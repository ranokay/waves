"""The queue ledger's FINISHING word: finalize-progress plumbing.

The stream bytes landing is not the work landing: extraction, tagging (with
its lyrics and cover fetches) and the move to the destination all still run
while the track's pct sits at 100, which used to read as a DOWNLOADING word
stuck fully lit. The drawer now hands that word off to FINISHING, filled by
``fpct``: a second progress axis fed from the engine's finalize-step
boundaries (``Download._note_stage``, overridden by ``_TrackedDownload``).

These tests pin the plumbing end to end of the Python side:
  * the tracked download emits the fraction under the row's key (the identity
    id when the track is a merge-plan member, exactly like item() does),
  * the bridge's lifecycle handler stores it on the row,
  * a plain "running" event (a track starting, or RE-starting on retry)
    resets it, so a retry never opens on the previous attempt's full word.
