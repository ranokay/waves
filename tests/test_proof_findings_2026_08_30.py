"""What the headless two-tree proof run of the audit-fix branch turned up.

Every fix on the branch was proven to hold and nothing regressed, but driving
the fixed app for real surfaced fourteen NEW problems the fixes had introduced
or left open. These are the guards for the behavioural half of them; the
guard-shaped ones (a test that could not fail) live beside the tests they
fence, and the updater/path/redactor ones with their own subjects.

  N-02  signing out during a search latched the busy spinner for good
  N-03  a rollup ended red over a run in which every member landed
  N-14  the F-10 release was half a release, the F-13 stale refusal left its
