"""The cover and the lyrics follow the audio into the library, never lead it.

The sidecars were moved into place before the audio file they belong to, so a
move that then failed (a share going away, a full disk, an occupied name) left a
cover.jpg and a .lrc sitting in the library for a track that never arrived.
Nothing removes them afterwards either: the app never deletes a user-visible
file, by design. They now move only once the audio has really landed.
