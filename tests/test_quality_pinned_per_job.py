"""A download finishes at the quality it was queued at.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Streams are asked for at the SHARED tidal session's audio quality, and saving
a new audio quality writes it to that session at once (issue #9, so the choice
takes effect without a restart). That also silently retargeted work the user
had already started: a queue full of albums lined up at HI-RES began arriving
at HIGH the moment the setting changed, mid-run, and the drawer re-stated
every queued row to match.

Now each row records the quality it was queued at (``askQuality``) and its job
carries that quality (``_TrackedDownload._pinned_quality``), written onto the
session inside ``tidal.stream_lock``, the lock that already serialises every
stream fetch in the process. A change in Settings therefore applies to what is
queued NEXT; what is queued or running keeps its quality, and the drawer keeps
stating it (test_queue_expected_tier.py).

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
Method-bound stubs, no display and no session: the row records the setting at
enqueue; the runner hands that quality to the download it builds; the download
writes it on the session for the fetch and puts back what it found; an Atmos
track is left alone (it carries its own session and quality); and the skip /
upgrade rank follows the job's quality, not the current setting.

The Atmos case is fenced twice, and both fences perform the session switch
inside the call the way config.py really does. A recorder-only parent cannot:
it returns with the session as it entered, so a restore of that same value is
invisible, and that is how the pin once passed every test while restoring the
stereo tier over the Atmos session. The single-fetch test now says the session
still holds the Atmos quality afterwards and nothing was restored; the
MULTI-track run says every Atmos track is asked at the Atmos quality, because
the switch writes that quality only when it has to BUILD the session, so a
restore over it is never undone and the damage shows on the NEXT track.
