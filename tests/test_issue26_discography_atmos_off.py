"""With the Atmos setting off, a discography sweep prefers the stereo edition.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF (issue #26)
--------------------------------
Since the two-rows rule (test_atmos_is_its_own_row.py) the Atmos edition keys
apart from its stereo twin in every same-release grouping, so it survives the
discography's dedup and edition handling as its own album. Nothing after that
asked the Atmos setting: the sweep queued the Atmos edition beside the stereo
one, every track of it is Atmos-only, and the engine's "nothing else to fetch"
clause (test_atmos_only_downloads_anyway.py) then delivered spatial files to a
user who had turned Atmos off.

THE RULE
--------
The setting means "prefer stereo where there is a choice", and a bulk sweep is
where the choice is made: with the setting off, _drop_spatial_editions leaves
out every Atmos-only release whose stereo twin is also in the sweep. A spatial
release with NO stereo twin anywhere in the sweep stays, downloaded as Atmos by
the engine's own clause: dropping it would put a hole in the discography, the
exact harm that retired the old exclusion apparatus. An explicitly clicked
ATMOS row never passes through the sweep and downloads as it always did.

Pairing uses the edition base key without its Atmos kind, so a
"(Dolby Atmos)"-suffixed twin still meets its plainly-titled stereo edition,
and it looks across both buckets, so a guest Atmos release pairs with a stereo
twin wherever the sweep holds it.
