"""'Download discography' includes music videos when their source toggle is on.

The ``video_download`` flag used to sit under Settings > Downloads and was
wired to nothing: manual video downloads never consult it (``dl.item()``
allows videos by default) and a whole-artist download only ever gathered
albums, EPs and guest tracks. It is now a discography source toggle (Settings
> Discography & editions, beside Albums / EPs & singles / Featured on) and
``downloadArtist`` queues the artist's music videos when it is on. These
tests pin the wiring end to end: the schema placement, the queueing, the
off-by-default restraint, and the partial-scan refusal when the video fetch
fails.
