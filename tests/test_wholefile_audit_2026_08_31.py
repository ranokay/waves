"""The pre-release whole-file audit of 2026-08-31, one guard per finding.

RELEASING.md's whole-file arm re-reads a fixed list of functions end to end
whether or not they changed, because the worst defects this app has shipped
were silent: no crash, no error, just wrong behaviour repeating forever. This
round found eight, and every one of them is fenced off here.

Each test states the user-visible sequence it prevents, and each was checked
against the unfixed code first: reverting its fix turns the test red.

  A  a copy at its release's ceiling read as not-owned once the setting rose
     (pinned in tests/test_ownership_ceiling.py, beside the rest of that
     function's matrix)
  B  an honest delivery counted as a degraded attempt, freezing the upgrade
  D  a playlist entry listed twice landed a second, numbered copy
  F  dismissing the folder gate left a rollup that could never finish
  G  a download held for automatic replay was credited as failed
  I  a bulk clear withdrew the row of a job already downloading
  J  STOP left held downloads for the recovery watch to start again
  K  a withdrawn row left its best-of-both plan for the next plain click
