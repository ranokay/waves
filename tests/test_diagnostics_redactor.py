"""Zero-leakage tests for the diagnostics redactor.

The scrubber is recall-first: a missed identifier in a log a user attaches to
a public issue is strictly worse than an over-redaction. This corpus is
deliberately nasty (identity strings embedded mid-sentence, inside URLs,
JSON, Windows paths, tracebacks) and the assertions are absolute: after
scrubbing, none of the tagged values may survive anywhere in the output.

When a future feature introduces a new secret shape, add it here FIRST and
watch the test fail; then teach the redactor (usually one register_secret call
or one denylist entry).
