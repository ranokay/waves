"""An expanded queue row builds a bounded number of ledger rows.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The per-track ledger was written for albums, where a row is 10 to 30 tracks,
and it builds every row at once (the Repeater is not virtualised, and a ledger
row is four texts, two DecryptText cells and three running Behaviors). Opening
the ledger to playlists and mixes pointed that at collections which are
routinely hundreds of tracks and can be thousands, so an unbounded count spent
a quarter of a second of the GUI thread building rows nobody could see, and
then paid for all of them again on every progress tick.

Worse, the hover PEEK reached the same code: the 30px sliver clips the height
but not the work, so merely dragging the pointer across a large playlist row
built the whole ledger.

Both are now ceilings on how many delegates exist (root.queueLedgerMax and
root.queueLedgerPeek). Nothing else changed: the whole list is still in
root.queueTracks and every row's live state still arrives, so a smaller
collection is untouched and shows every track exactly as before. An expansion
that cannot show everything says how many rows it is not showing.

The expanded ceiling is proved on the real Main.qml (subprocess, like its
siblings), in both directions: a small collection shows every track and no
trailing line, a large one stops at the ceiling and says what is left. The peek
ceiling cannot be driven headlessly (it hangs off a real hover), so what is
pinned here is that it exists and is small, and that a row which is neither
expanded nor hovered builds nothing at all.
