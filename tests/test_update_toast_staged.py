"""The update toast never names a version the restart will not land.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
install() refuses to stage a second update over an already-armed helper, on
purpose: the two would race the same backup folder (tests/test_updater.py pins
that refusal). What it does in that case is hand back the STAGED result, and it
does so before it has looked at the release it was asked for.

So on Windows, with a swap staged yesterday and never restarted into: the toast
offered today's newer release, the user pressed INSTALL, the toast said that
newer version was installed, and the restart landed yesterday's. The Settings
card was honest throughout (it pins the staged version into its own copy); the
toast was not, because it renders its own idea of the version and had never
been told the install went nowhere near it.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
An offer is refused outright while a restart is pending (the pill goes on
saying what the restart will give, and the newer release is offered again by
the check that follows the restart), and the installed label reads the staged
version whenever the app knows one.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as the other QML scenarios: building
the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
