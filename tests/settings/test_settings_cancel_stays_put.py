"""CANCEL on the settings page discards edits without leaving the page.

CANCEL discards the pending edits in place. Closing the page
reads as "get me out of here" rather than "undo what I typed": the user loses
their place, and the page they were reading, to take back a single keystroke.
It must throw away the pending edits in place.

Two things are easy to lose in a later edit and are pinned here:

- it must NOT close the page (no ``closed()`` from the button);
- it must re-pull the schema, because a save earlier in the same visit leaves
  ``groups`` holding pre-save values (``applySettings`` deliberately keeps
  ``editMap`` so the controls show what was just saved), so dropping
  ``editMap`` alone would repaint the page with stale text;
- and it must hold the scroll position while those cards rebuild, which is the
  app-wide no-visible-scroll rule.
