"""The bulk-download confirm must be switchable back ON.

DOWNLOAD ALL on a Browse playlist category asks before queueing the whole set,
and the dialog's "Don't ask again" persists ``confirm_category_download =
False``. That flag was absent from ``settingsSchema``, which has three knock-on
effects, because the schema is the single list everything else iterates:

* no toggle anywhere in the settings page, so the only way to switch it back
  on was editing the config file by hand;
* ``_factory_default_values`` skips it, so even "Reset all settings" left the
  confirm muted;
* nothing tells the tile the value changed, so a toggle would not take effect
  until a relaunch.

One accidental tick therefore silenced a confirm about queueing an entire
category, permanently.
