"""Every settings save must undo the transient ffmpeg injections first.

THE BUG
-------
``Download`` force-disables ``video_convert_mp4`` and ``extract_flac`` **in
memory** when ffmpeg is absent, and ``_resolve_ffmpeg`` injects the managed
binary path into ``path_binary_ffmpeg``. ``Settings`` is a singleton and
``save()`` serialises the whole dataclass, so any bare ``settings.save()``
writes those transient values to disk.

``applySettings`` and ``setVideoQuality`` knew this and restored first. Three
other save sites did not: ``keepDownloadFolder`` (answering the
download-folder nudge with "keep it"), ``muteCategoryDlConfirm`` (a plain
"Don't ask again" click) and the download-folder auto-heal. Answering a nudge
about folders therefore silently turned FLAC extraction and video conversion
off on disk, invisibly until the next launch (the settings page renders the
pre-damage snapshot), and with ffmpeg present it also persisted a machine path
containing the username into settings.json, the file the bug template asks
users to paste publicly.

THE FIX routes every save through ``_save_settings``, which restores both
before saving. This test fences the invariant at the helper AND at the slots
that regressed, so a newly added save site is caught by the audit test below.
