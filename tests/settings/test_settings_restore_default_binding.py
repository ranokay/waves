"""Restore default must RE-BIND the field, never overwrite its text.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
The per-field "Restore default" link assigned the box directly:

    strField.text = modelData.default_value
    page.setv(modelData.key, modelData.default_value)

An imperative write to a TextField's ``text`` destroys the
``text: page.val(modelData)`` binding declared on it, and the SettingsPage is a
permanent child of Main.qml whose Repeater delegates outlive a close/reopen
(``refreshSchema`` only re-runs after an actual save). So Restore default
followed by CANCEL left the box displaying the shipped default for the rest of
the session while the persisted setting, and every download, still used the
user's custom value. The link beside it still read "Restore default" (its own
binding was alive and re-evaluated against the real value), and SAVE was greyed
out, so the page showed a contradiction the user could not resolve.

``Qt.binding`` does both jobs: it shows the default immediately AND repairs a
binding the user's own typing had already broken.

The page's Browse-dialog path documents the same hazard and takes the same care
(see the comment above ``folderDlg``), so this is checked structurally: any
assignment to a settings field's ``text`` must go through ``Qt.binding``.
