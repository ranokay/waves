"""Exporting a diagnostic report must not rewrite the user's privacy prefs.

THE BUG
-------
The two diagnostics toggles apply live via ``setWavesPref`` but never set
``needsRefresh``, and ``refreshSchema()`` is the only thing that re-reads
``waves.settingsSchema()``. ``onActiveChanged`` clears ``editMap`` on every
reopen but rebuilds ``groups`` only when ``needsRefresh`` is set, which only the
Save button does. So after one close and reopen the card rendered the stale
baked-in values, and the EXPORT REPORT handler pushed **those** booleans back
through ``setWavesPref`` before calling ``exportDiagnostics()``, which reads the
pref it had just clobbered.

The card's own copy invites exactly that sequence: "Turn on, reproduce the
problem, then export." The user turned on verbose diagnostics and content
redaction, reproduced their bug, came back, clicked Export, and silently got
both switched off, the freeze watchdog and perf sampler stopped, and a bundle
containing the searches and titles they had asked to hide.

THE FIX has two halves: the export handler no longer re-pushes the prefs (the
toggles already apply live, so the backend holds the truth), and each toggle
marks ``needsRefresh`` so a reopen shows the real value instead of the stale
one.
