"""The quality badge's tier menu (issue #36), on the real rows.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Every row-level quality badge (track rows, album rows, the expanded album
panel) is a QualPick around the app's QualTag. A choice made on the bridge
must reach the badge: the pill states the chosen tier on a tinted ground; an
album's choice turns every one of its track badges too, floored by what each
track can land; a track's own choice beats its album's; choosing the Settings
tier under an album that chose is kept as DEFAULT (the track stops
inheriting) and is a plain clear otherwise; a video row and an Atmos pill
offer no menu; the menu toggles (a second click on the badge closes it, it
must not close-then-reopen); a tier above the item's ceiling is listed NOT
OFFERED and inert; the DEFAULT mark follows the setting live; and a download
asks at the choice WITHOUT spending it, so the badge and the copy that lands
state the same tier.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.

    # springing, and a stuck ghost leaves the old tier's word printed over the
    # new one. Checked mid-flight as well as after, or a swap that never
    # started would pass the parked half on its own.
