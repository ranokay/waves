"""The "Videos preview on hover" escape hatch (Settings > Advanced).

Resting the pointer on a video thumbnail grows a sound-on live preview card
(the hover peek). Anyone who does not want video and audio starting from a
mere hover can turn it off: thumbnails then stay still and videos play only on
click. This pins the three things that make the toggle real: it ships on by
default, it is offered as a labelled bool in the Advanced section, and
flipping it notifies the QML, which re-reads the pref on that signal and gates
root.peekOpen (the single entry point every thumbnail's dwell timer funnels
into, so one check silences them all).

The sibling of tests/ui/test_hover_motion_pref.py and
tests/ui/test_art_hover_tilt_pref.py, and deliberately their twin: the escape
hatches should stay pinned the same way.
