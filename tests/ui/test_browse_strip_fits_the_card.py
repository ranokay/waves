"""The hover strip on a browse card stays inside the artwork.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The strip is sized by its own words (each half hugs its label), and nothing
capped it against the card it rides on. The artwork clips, and the pill is
centred, so a strip wider than the cover was cut off at BOTH ends: the pill
lost its rounded corners and the words lost their first and last letters.

It was never a corner case. Measured with the real UI font at the real 10px,
on the ordinary 200px card the everyday DOWNLOAD and IN LIBRARY ran over by
about 10px and DOWNLOADED by about 27, so every state but MAYBE and the
partial count overflowed. Only the worst one was ever noticed.

The fence is the artwork itself: whatever the strip says, in whatever font the
platform gives it, the pill must fit on the cover. That is the boundary that
actually clips, and it holds the fix (the halves' padding gives way as the
words grow) without restating its arithmetic, so a wider word, a wider font or
a smaller card fails here rather than on someone's screen.

Both hard-won lessons from the sibling scenarios apply: the three widest words
must really be on screen (a probe that finds no strip proves nothing), and the
run happens in a SUBPROCESS because building the bridge installs process-global
handlers.
