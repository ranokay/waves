"""Back navigation input: the macOS swipe filter and the side-button MouseArea.

The bridge's event filter handles ONE thing now, the discrete macOS
three-finger swipe (NativeGesture), and it is installed on the window's
content item, never on the window or the application. A Python event filter
is a crossing into the interpreter for every event its target receives; on
the window that was one per frame (the render loop's update request), each
waiting for the interpreter behind the launch workers, sampled 2026-09-11 as
the largest single GUI-thread cost while the landing built under the boot
water. The content item receives only what no item under the pointer
accepted, which is the swipe and nothing else while the scene is idle.

The mouse back and forward side buttons moved to a MouseArea at the top of
the scene (Main.qml), pinned here by text: it accepts exactly those two
buttons, so every other press, wheel and hover passes through to the page.

The window's activate and deactivate events are no longer swallowed: the
per-item walk they trigger cost ~0.3-0.5 s only while an application-wide
filter made every hop cross into Python, which no filter does any more.
