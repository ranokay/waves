"""Guard: the queue drawer's per-track Repeater must not rebuild on live ticks.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
While an album downloads, the backend streams per-track updates twice a
second (``queueTrackState`` on lifecycle changes, ``queueTrackPct`` from the
500ms progress poll), and each one reassigns ``root.queueTracks`` wholesale
with fresh array instances. The drawer's expanded/peeked track list used to
bind that array directly as its Repeater model, so EVERY tick tore down and
rebuilt every row delegate. Each rebuild needs a layout-settle frame, which
read as the hover-peek sliver visibly vibrating under the pointer (and burned
CPU rebuilding rows whose text barely changed).

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The Repeater's model is a row COUNT, not the array: delegates stay alive
across ticks and each row re-evaluates its own snapshot (``td``) in place, so
a tick only repaints the texts that changed.

The count now arrives through an int property on the row rather than inline on
the model line, because it is also where the ledger's ceiling is applied (see
test_queue_ledger_cap.py). That is the same shape, so this guard checks it
structurally rather than by matching one expression: whatever the ledger's
model names must be declared an int, and anything deriving a count from
``root.queueTracks`` must take ``.length`` rather than carrying the array.
