"""A delisted track reads UNAVAILABLE in the queue, and its album still finishes.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
TIDAL delists tracks. The engine skips them (``allow_streaming`` false) and says
so in the log, but it returns the same empty-handed ``(False, "")`` a broken
download returns, and the GUI used to tally that as a failure. A commentary
edition whose every track TIDAL had withdrawn came back as
``RuntimeError: 15 of 15 tracks failed``: the album red, a RETRY button that
could never succeed, and nothing on screen saying who had refused (issue #25).

The word is the whole point of the fix, so it is asserted on the REAL delegate:
the bridge's own _track_lifecycle feeds the per-track registry, the expansion
renders it, and the outcome column has to read UNAVAILABLE, distinct from both
FAILED and the green COMPLETED beside it. Reading it as FAILED would put a retry
in front of the user for a file that no longer exists anywhere.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
