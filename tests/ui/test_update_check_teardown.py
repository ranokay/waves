"""The update-check worker must survive outliving the bridge.

shutdown() drains the pools with bounded waits, so a check parked in a
network read can return after the bridge's C++ object is destroyed; its
plain ``appUpdateChecked.emit`` then raised RuntimeError ("Signal source
has been deleted") and was logged as a background-worker crash (three
occurrences in the 2026-07-13 debug export, and reproducible by quitting
a headless harness during the startup check). The fix routes worker-side
emits through ``_emit_from_worker``, which resolves the signal by name and
swallows only that teardown RuntimeError.

Qt-free, per the test_audit_backend.py pattern: the real bridge methods are
bound onto a bare stub, the pool runs inline, and signal stand-ins either
record emits or raise like a deleted QObject would.
