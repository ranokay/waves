"""The one-time update opt-in prompt (updateOptInGate).

Update checks default OFF and nothing in the app ever asked, so users on old
builds miss fixes for problems they are actively having. The prompt appears
once, at the end of the first-run chain (login > FFmpeg > terms) or on the
first launch of an existing install, and offers the once-a-day check.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
1. Answering the prompt with "turn on" must actually enable the pref, persist
   it, refresh the Settings page underneath, and fire a check immediately, so
   a release that is already out surfaces this session instead of tomorrow.
2. Answering "not now" must change nothing: auto_update stays off and no
   check fires (the no-unsolicited-connections promise holds).
3. The QML gate must keep the shape that makes it one-time and non-naggy:
   gated on the whole first-run chain, on the pref being off, on the answered
   flag, and on the two-dismissal cap for click-aways.
