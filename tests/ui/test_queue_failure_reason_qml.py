"""The failed row's reason reaches the drawer, not just the bridge.

The bridge stores WHY a download failed on the queue row ("6 of 501 tracks
failed"). That value is worth nothing unless the drawer can read it, and QML
fails at exactly this silently: a ListModel fixes its roles from the first
object appended, so a role missing from ``queueRowObject`` does not exist on
any row, reads as ``undefined`` in the delegate, and produces no warning and no
binding error. The reported symptom was a row whose entire diagnosis was the
word "Failed", so a check that only asked the bridge would pass over the very
gap this is about.

So the real Main.qml is booted offscreen, driven through the real bridge slots,
and asked what the row holds and what the sub-status line renders.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios (shares
``support.qml.boot_main_qml``).
