"""The queue drawer is dragged wider by its own edge, and the edge holds.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
1. The handle drifting off the border. `queueDrawer.contentItem` is NOT the
   ColumnLayout declared inside the Drawer, it is the Popup's own popup item,
   sitting at leftPadding and already spanning the full height. A handle
   anchored to it without undoing that inset floats beside the drawer instead
   of on it, which is a gap the user sees and cannot grab. Nothing warns: the
   thing renders perfectly, just in the wrong place.

2. The panel MOVING instead of only resizing. A Drawer places itself from
   position * width, so changing its width mid-drag can slide the whole panel.
   The right edge must stay welded to the window edge through every width.

3. The floor going. 420 is where the quality a row states and the title it
   states it for stop fighting for the same pixels, so no drag may go under it.

4. The width being forgotten. It is remembered across launches like the window
   frame, and what is stored is the width that was ASKED for rather than the
   clamped one, so a drawer narrowed by a small window widens again on a large
   one instead of being permanently cut down by it.

5. The clamp being read once. The width is dragged, so a window that later
   shrinks would leave an over-wide drawer hanging off the side unless the
   ceiling is re-read from the current window width.

6. The save being a debounce and nothing else. Widen the drawer and quit, which
   is how the gesture actually ends, and the settled write is still pending: the
   close has to flush it the way the window frame's does, or the width the user
   just chose leaves with the timer that never fired.

Drives the REAL Main.qml with REAL mouse events, so it covers the handler and
the Drawer's own dismiss gesture: a horizontal drag is how a Drawer closes, and
this drags in exactly that axis. If preventStealing ever stops winning, the
drawer shuts here instead of resizing and the width assertions fail.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
