"""A queued row can take back "you already have this" once it stops being true.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Expanding a queued album runs a second pass that says which of its tracks you
already hold, and the drawer paints those rows IN LIBRARY. A one-way answer
breaks it: a worker that hands the answer to the GUI thread only when it
found something

    if marks:
        self._queueOwnedFetched.emit(qid, marks)

never delivers "none of these, actually". _apply_owned_marks is the ONLY
writer of the kept marks, so the previous marks stand, every later merge
re-stamps them, and the store is only emptied when the row leaves the queue.

What that looks like to a person: expand a queued album, three songs say IN
LIBRARY. Delete those files, or the drive holding them drops off, or switch the
library scan off. Collapse and re-expand, which is the one gesture that asks the
question again. The answer correctly comes back empty, the guard swallows it,
and the drawer paints the three stale marks straight back. Nothing but quitting
the app clears them, exactly the restart-to-refresh pattern this project
forbids.

The answer reaches the GUI thread on every SUCCESSFUL lookup, an empty one
included. A lookup that RAISED still says nothing: it knows nothing either way,
so it leaves whatever is on screen alone. Both halves are pinned here.

Two neighbouring promises are pinned with them, because an "un-say" that keeps
every assertion above can still be built wrong in either direction: the empty
answer must un-say marks for the row it is about and no other queued row, and
the lookup must stay the SECOND pass, so a slow drive delays the marks and never
the track list itself.

HOW THIS IS DRIVEN
------------------
The carcass is a real WavesBridge (``__new__`` plus ``QObject.__init__``, so the
class's own Qt signals work and nothing else from ``__init__`` runs). The REAL
signals are used rather than stand-ins, for two reasons: an empty answer has to
survive the real QVariant hop to be worth anything, and the marks then land in
the real _apply_owned_marks and the real _merge_queue_tracks, so these tests can
assert on the rows the drawer would paint instead of on a dict. Recorders are
connected alongside. The carcass connects the signals the way ``__init__`` does,
so the last test pins that wiring on the real class.

Only _predict_skips is replaced: what the lookup answers is its own subject
(tests/ui/test_queue_owned_prediction.py). What is pinned here is what
loadQueueTracks does with the answer it gets back.
