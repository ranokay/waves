"""A queue row states a quality, and states the RIGHT one.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Two ways the drawer's quality readout goes quiet or goes wrong, both silent.

1. The field never arriving. The bridge puts `quality` on every queue row, but
   the drawer's model is a ListModel, and a ListModel fixes its roles from the
   first object appended to it. A field the reconcile forgets to name therefore
   does not exist on ANY row: `model.quality` reads undefined in the delegate,
   with no warning and no binding error, and the pill silently renders nothing.
   Every row then carries a tier the drawer cannot see.

2. The field arriving and being outranked by a stale promise. The pill starts
   out saying what the job ASKED for, which is all there is to say until the
   files land. Once they land they are the truth, and the case that matters is
   a release with no hi-res master answering a HI-RES request in LOSSLESS from
   end to end. MIXED cannot catch that (one tier is not a mix), so without an
   explicit "they all agree, and they agree on something else" the pill kept
   stating the request while the ledger under it stated the delivery.

3. Both of those readouts only working once the row is EXPANDED. They were fed
   from root.queueTracks[qid], filled by loadQueueTracks, which is a network
   fetch and so only runs on expand. A row nobody opened kept advertising its
   request forever and could never say MIXED, which is exactly the row that
   needed to: nobody was reading its ledger, so the pill was the only place the
   downgrade could have shown. The bridge now rolls its per-track registry up
   onto the row itself, and this pins that, by never expanding the row at all
   and asserting the track list stays unloaded while the pill still follows.

4. The expanded ledger stating a tier only once a track's turn comes. A track
   that has not started is "pending", which is what a fetched track list starts
   in and so what a queued album is made of from end to end, and no track event
   ever says "queued" (the relay emits running/failed/done/skipped only). Read
   the request for "queued" and "running" alone, as it was, and the tier column
   is blank for every track but the one in flight, which is the stretch where
   the request is the only thing there is to say.

So this drives the REAL bridge, the REAL reconcile and the REAL delegate: it
enqueues through the bridge, reads the tier off the instantiated row, then
reports deliveries through the bridge's own _track_lifecycle (the one path a
delivered tier is ever learned on) and watches the pill follow them.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
