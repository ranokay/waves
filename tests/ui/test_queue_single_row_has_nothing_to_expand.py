"""The queue's one-item releases answer a hover but offer no expansion, and
the peek settles where it stops.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Two things a livetest called out on the drawer, both on the same row.

1. A SINGLE still wore the expansion. The row's affordance was gated on
   ``model.collection`` alone, which is true for any album/playlist/mix job,
   so a one-track release got the caret, the pointing-hand cursor, a click
   target and a track fetch, all to reveal a list of one line the card's own
   title already said. The expansion gate now also asks that the release is not
   exactly one item. Exactly one: a ``tracks`` of 0 means the count was never
   known, and that row still needs its ledger.

   The HOVER is separate, and a later livetest said so: a row that does nothing
   whatsoever under the pointer reads as a broken row. So every collection row
   still peeks (``peekable``), and the single's sliver says it is a single,
   while only ``expandable`` rows carry the caret, the hand cursor, the track
   fetch and a working click.

2. The peek SPRANG. Its height Behavior used ``Easing.OutBack`` with an
   overshoot, which by definition drives the value past its target and brings
   it back. On a peek that is driven by the POINTER rather than by a click,
   that reads as the card opening and then retracting on its own while the
   pointer sits still, and on the way out it aims the height below zero before
   returning to it. Sweeping the pointer down a list of rows played the wobble
   once per row, which is what got reported as glitchy. A hover response has to
   settle where it stops, so the easing must not be one of the springy families.

The first is proved on the real Main.qml in a subprocess, like its siblings in
``test_queue_playlist_expands.py``; the second on the QML source, because the
peek is reachable only from a real pointer and the property that carries the
overshoot is a declared constant.
