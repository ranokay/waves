"""The exit-while-downloading warning (exitGate).

Closing the window while queue items are queued or running silently killed
them: the app exits, worker threads die mid-file, and unfinished tracks have
to be downloaded again. The gate vetoes that close once, asks, and lets the
user mute it for good.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
1. onClosing must veto (close.accepted = false) only when downloads are
   active, the warning is not muted, and the exit was not already confirmed,
   so EXIT ANYWAY's re-close actually leaves and an idle queue exits
   instantly.
2. Both buttons must do exactly what they say: KEEP DOWNLOADING only closes
   the gate, EXIT ANYWAY confirms then calls root.close(), and only those two
   persist the "don't warn me again" checkbox.
3. The mute flag lives in QSettings (the "setup" block), NOT waves.json.
4. The gate re-arms per attempt: opening resets confirmed and the checkbox,
   so a cancelled exit warns again next time.
