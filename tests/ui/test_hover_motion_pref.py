"""The "Hover controls slide in" escape hatch (Settings > Advanced).

Hover controls rise in with a bounce by default; anyone who finds the motion
distracting can turn it off and get the plain fade back. This pins the three
things that make the toggle real: it ships on by default, it is offered as a
labelled bool in the Advanced section, and flipping it notifies the QML (which
re-reads the pref on that signal, see Main.qml's hoverMotion).
