"""A browse card carries its library verdict, and only while that verdict holds.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
A browse page is built on a worker thread and each of its album cards is
"dressed" there with the answers the card would otherwise ask the bridge for
at creation time: whether the album is already in the local library, and
whether it has been downloaded before. That exists because a bridge call
inside a delegate's incubation slice waits for the interpreter behind every
busy worker, which at launch was most of what the boot water dropped frames
on. Two things about doing the work early:

1. The verdict is baked BEFORE the card exists. A card that is built after a
   library publish that the payload was dressed before holds an answer from
   the wrong index, and the signal that makes a live card re-ask has already
   fired, so it keeps that answer until the next publish, which for a settled
   library never comes: the card prints DOWNLOAD over an album on disk. Each
   card carries the publish count its verdict came from and compares it.

2. The dressing is one library lookup and one ownership lookup per card, so a
   page of fifty is a real span of time after the caller's own staleness
   check. A sign-out and sign-in inside it painted the previous account's
   personalised rows over the new account's page.
