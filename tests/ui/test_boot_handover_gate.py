"""The launch sequence must cover the Browse landing's assembly.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Browse landing shelves incubate through asynchronous Loaders, and the
"open water" launch overlay exists precisely to hide that assembly: the
wordmark holds over the water while the page builds behind it, so the
interface appears finished. The overlay used to lift on a fixed schedule
regardless, and a landing still building (a boot-time revalidation of a
dozen shelves) was then watched dropping in shelf by shelf, as if the page
were scrolling itself (reported from livetesting).

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
bootOverlay.handover() refuses to start the zoom while root.browseBuilding
is true, marking itself held; the build veil clearing calls it again. A cap
timer expires the hold so a stalled build can never pin the launch screen.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as test_search_results_surface_steal:
building the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak into
the rest of the suite.
