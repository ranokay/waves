"""The qid index stays a faithful mirror of the queue list.

_queue_item() sits on the per-tick progress path (_report_pct), and a
discography with videos can hold ~2000 rows, so it reads a qid -> row dict
instead of scanning the list. The dict is only correct if every mutation of
self._queue keeps it in step: appends add, wholesale rebuilds reindex. These
tests bind the real queue methods over a minimal stub and check the mirror
after each kind of mutation.
