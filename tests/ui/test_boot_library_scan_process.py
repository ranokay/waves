"""The launch library sweep runs in the scanner process, from construction.

Deferring the sweep until the boot reveal would hold this process's
interpreter with its walk and drop frames from the boot water. The walk runs
in a child process (waves.library.worker) that shares nothing with the GUI
thread, so the sweep starts at construction, which is what the launch
sequence exists to mask. Pinned: the job goes to the worker with the cache
and root, the outcome lands on the index object, a worker that cannot be
used hands the job back to the in-process scan, and the reveal is not what
releases the sweep.
