"""Nothing new may run on the interpreter during the launch water.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The launch water is a QML Video in the same scene graph as the interface,
so every one of its frames needs the GUI thread, and the GUI thread waits
for the interpreter lock whenever any Python runs anywhere. A pool job
dispatched between the bridge's construction and the reveal therefore
competes with the picture for every frame it holds the lock. The library
walk did exactly that (now a child process, waves.library_worker); a
presence-index build did (now the sqlite cache itself); and every fix
before this one was undone by the next feature that added a boot job.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The scenario below builds the real bridge in a sandbox with every pool
start and thread start recorded, drives it to the reveal, and compares the
jobs that ran against the allowlist here. A new boot job fails the test
until it is added below WITH the reason it may hold the interpreter under
the water (short, or off the interpreter, or measured harmless with the
native render-loop log: see tools/launch_probe.py). Runs in a SUBPROCESS
like the other boot scenarios: building the bridge installs process-global
handlers that must not leak into the rest of the suite.
