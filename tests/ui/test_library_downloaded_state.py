"""An album the library scan says you fully own renders as DOWNLOADED, and
that claim can always be clicked through.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The Download button itself is the prevention: DownloadButton resolves the
album's library presence (its lib* properties) and a FULL local copy renders
the same inert DOWNLOADED state the ownership rollup uses, so an album you
already have cannot be re-downloaded by accident. A PARTIAL copy and an
unmatched album must keep a LIVE Download button (completing an album is not
a duplicate, and no match means nothing to prevent). Display is the only
consumer of the presence answer: the engine never sees it, and per-track
buttons stay independent, so a wrong tag match is always recoverable.

The claim is inferred from tags, so it can be wrong, and a wrong one must not
be terminal. So the DOWNLOADED-by-library-scan button stays CLICKABLE and
opens libraryClaimGate, which names the matched folder and offers DOWNLOAD
ANYWAY. Two halves of that are pinned here, and both matter:

* the claim is clickable and its DOWNLOAD ANYWAY really reaches
  waves.downloadAlbum with the right album id (detection must never prevent a
  download the user could otherwise make), and
* a DOWNLOADED that comes from the OWNERSHIP STORE is not a guess but a
  record of a download Waves made, so it stays inert and opens nothing.

Also pinned here: the verdict's two axes as the user reads them. Identity
("sure") picks the words and colour: a proven complete copy wears the green
fact wording with its media noun (ALBUM DOWNLOADED / ALBUM IN LIBRARY), an
unproven one hedges in gold MAYBE IN LIBRARY, and the badge's "?" follows the
same axis. Coverage ("full") picks the shape: a short copy stays a live cyan
PARTIALLY IN LIBRARY button. And the queued face stays frozen through
"running" (the state roll's exit), so the progress handoff never flashes the
idle label.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
