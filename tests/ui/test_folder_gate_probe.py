"""Download-folder reachability gate (_probe_folder_verdict): a set folder is
write-probed before a download starts, because a stale network mount can pass
exists()/is_dir() while every real write fails, and the macOS remount pattern
(share comes back as "/Volumes/Name 1") is healed automatically.

Pure staticmethod, so no Qt or bridge construction is needed.
