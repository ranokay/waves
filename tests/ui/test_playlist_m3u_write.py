"""The playlist m3u is the one file written straight into the library.

Every track, cover and lyric reaches the library through _move_file, which
stages a hidden temp sibling and swaps it into place, so an interrupted write
can only ever leave a throwaway file behind. The m3u opened the real name in
truncating mode instead: a crash, a full disk or a dropped share mid-write left
the user with an emptied or half-written playlist where a complete one had been.

Its name also skipped the illegal-character stand-ins that every other name in
the library goes through, so a playlist called "?" lost its name entirely while
an album called "?" kept one (issue #16).
