"""A resolved Browse category must not be trusted for the life of the process.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
``_category_pl`` had no TTL, no revalidation and no eviction, and was cleared
only at logout. Waves is designed to run for weeks (see the always-on freshness
rule), so this was reachable without anything going wrong:

  Day 1: DOWNLOAD ALL on a category says "Download 24 playlists?", the user
  cancels. Weeks later the category holds 30. The drilled grid re-fetches and
  shows all 30, but the tile still reports 24 and downloadPlaylistCategory
  queues exactly the day-1 objects, including any TIDAL has since removed.

Contrast openBrowsePage, which revalidates its cached page on every open.
Serving stale-then-revalidating is wrong HERE specifically: the resolve emit
runs whatever action the tile queued, so a late correction would arrive after
the confirm dialog had already been answered against the old count.
