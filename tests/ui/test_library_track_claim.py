"""A track row's download button has to answer for the library too.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
An album row has said ALBUM IN LIBRARY (or MAYBE, or PARTIALLY) for a while,
and a click on a claim opens the gate that explains the match. A TRACK row
said nothing: the small pill beside the title was the only tell, and the
button next to it looked exactly like a button for a song nobody had. So
clicking download on a track already on disk went straight through, silently,
which is what a user hit in a real session.

The button now carries the same verdict, on the same two axes minus the one a
track does not have. There is no coverage question for a song: it is on disk
or it is not, so presence alone is the done shape and identity alone picks the
words. Proven reads TRACK IN LIBRARY in green, unproven reads MAYBE IN LIBRARY
in gold, and BOTH stay clickable, because the track key is the most brittle
guess this app makes and a guess must never be the end of the conversation.

Four rows, four different reasons:

* a track whose holding folder proves the release  -> green, done;
* the same track with nothing to prove it against  -> gold MAYBE, done;
* a track the scan never saw                       -> untouched, live;
* a VIDEO whose title and artist DO match a row in the track index -> still
  live, because the scan only ever holds audio and a video must never wear an
  audio claim.

Then the gate itself: it must open on a track's claim, say "file" rather than
"folder", and DOWNLOAD ANYWAY must really download. A track needs no claim
override to do that (the bulk gate rides only on collection jobs), so the
proof here is that the click reaches downloadTrack with the track's own id.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as the other Main.qml scenarios:
building the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak into
the rest of the suite.
