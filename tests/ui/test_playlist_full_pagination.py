"""Regression for issue #12: playlists were capped at 200 tracks.

The playlist browse path paged obj.items() with a hard-coded two-page loop
(offsets 0 and 100), so any playlist longer than 200 tracks was silently
truncated in the track list even though the header count was right. The
paging now lives in backend._all_playlist_items and loops until the endpoint
returns a short page.
