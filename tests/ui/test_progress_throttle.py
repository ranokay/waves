"""Regression guard for the broadcast-progress rate gate (WavesBridge).

A single DASH-delivered track emits item() progress per segment with no upstream
throttle. Each downloadProgress broadcast reaches every instantiated download
control on the GUI thread, so an ungated burst stole scroll/art frames. The gate
(_should_broadcast_pct) coalesces the broadcast to a 0.5% min delta or a ~10 Hz
ceiling per media id, while never swallowing the first tick or the terminal 100%.

The gate is a pure function of (per-id last emit, monotonic clock), so a fake
clock exercises the time branch without sleeping.
