"""Regression guard: user content that is logged must be marked as content.

THE BUG
-------
``diagnostics.content()`` and the whole ``«…»`` content tier existed, were
tested in isolation, and were promised in the README and in the in-app help
("Also hide titles and searches"), but had **zero production call sites**. With
nothing marked, ``_CONTENT_RE`` matched nothing, ``scrub_content`` was an
identity function on every real line, and an export taken with
``redact_content=True`` shipped the user's raw search terms and media names
under a header reading ``content_redacted=True``.

Search terms reach disk even with verbose off: ``devlog.done`` re-emits at
WARNING when a search exceeds its budget, and ``_CrumbDumpHandler`` replays the
whole INFO ring at WARNING on any ERROR.

THE FIX marks the search needle and the engine's media-name log lines. These
tests fence the call sites (the thing that was missing), not the redactor
mechanism, which ``test_diagnostics_redactor.py`` already covers.
