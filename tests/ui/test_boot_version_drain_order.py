"""The launch handover plays its two beats in order, never on top of
each other.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The handover is read as one gesture: the version readout under the wordmark
empties out (a bar fills, dims, then clears its cells), and only then does
the wordmark zoom toward the viewer. The wait between them was a fixed
700ms while the drain is a per-cell walk whose length follows the version
string ("v0.1.11" takes 792ms), so the last cells were still emptying after
the zoom had begun and the two beats were seen overlapping (reported from
livetesting).

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
bootHandover's pause is bound to bootBlk.runMs, the walk's own length, so
the readout is always finished before the zoom starts, for any version
string. This samples the running animation and pins the ORDER (last frame
with ink in the readout comes before the first frame of zoom), which holds
whatever the machine's timing, plus a loose bound proving the zoom still
follows promptly rather than after a dead beat.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as test_boot_handover_gate:
building the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak
into the rest of the suite.
