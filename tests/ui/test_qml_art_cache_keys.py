"""Regression guard: the warm cover-art pool must ask for covers the way the
pages do, or it pins nothing.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
Qt's pixmap cache is keyed on more than the url. The key is
``(url, requestRegion, requestSize, frame, providerOptions)``, and
``providerOptions`` carries the flags ``QQuickImage`` raises for
``PreserveAspectCrop`` and ``PreserveAspectFit``. Two ``Image`` elements on the
same url and the same ``sourceSize`` that differ only in ``fillMode`` are
therefore two separate cache entries: two fetches, two decodes, two pixmaps,
and neither one keeps the other alive.

Main.qml's warm pool (``warmArt`` / ``warmArtModel``) exists to hold a live
``Image`` for the last few hundred covers shown, because Qt keeps only about
2 MB of decoded-but-unreferenced pixmaps (measured on Qt 6.11: 40 to 60
thumbnails at search-row size, less than one page of results). The pool's
``Image`` was left at the default ``fillMode``, ``Image.Stretch``, while every
surface that actually paints a cover crops. So the pool fetched and decoded a
second, differently keyed copy of every cover and pinned that, the copy the
page had painted went unpinned, and a revisited page went back through the
loading placeholder as if the pool were not there. Reported from a livetest:
search, search something else, search the first thing again, and the covers
loaded from scratch.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The rule is mechanical: every ``Image`` in Main.qml that opts into the pixmap
cache (``cache: true``) must request its pixels the same way, so that one
warmed entry serves all of them. A new art surface that crops differently, or
a pool that stops cropping, fails here rather than silently halving the cache
hit rate. The other key components (``sourceSize``, and the properties below
that would split the key just as quietly) are pinned alongside it.

If a surface ever genuinely needs a different fill mode, it needs its own warm
entry too: teach ``warmArt`` the fill mode and key ``_warmSeen`` on it, then
add the surface here.
