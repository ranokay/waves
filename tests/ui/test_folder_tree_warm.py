"""Nothing may silently give up because the folder tree has not been swept yet.

The tree is written in exactly one place, the sweep inside ``_media_lists``, so
it is None on every cold start and again after a sign-out. Two paths failed
silently in that window:

1. DRILL-IN. Page cache v3 restores the playlists first page (folder rows and
   all) on a warm launch, so folder tiles are clickable seconds before any
   sweep runs. ``openPlaylistFolder`` answered a click in that window by
   emitting an empty payload, and the drill-in ListView has no empty state, no
   spinner and no retry: the view stayed blank until the user crumbed out and
   back in. ``downloadFolder`` already handled the same not-ready state
   explicitly ("Folder not loaded yet"); the open path did not.

2. DOWNLOAD. ``_playlist_template`` resolved ``{folder_path}`` to "" with no
   tree, which is correct for a playlist in no folder and wrong for one in a
   folder. Paste your own playlist's share link on a cold session and the
   tracks land in <base>/Playlists/Road Songs/; open My Tidal (the sweep runs)
   and download it again and they land in <base>/Playlists/Country/Road Songs/.
   check_file_exists only ever compares the destination it was handed, so
   nothing is skipped: a full second copy is written.
