"""Each queue row follows its OWN track's progress, not a namesake's.

THE BUG
-------
The engine registers one progress task per downloading item, described as
``[blue]Item '<display name>'`` with the name cut to 30 characters. The bridge
mirrored that string onto each queue row and polled percentages with
``{task.description: task.percentage}``.

A description built from ``"<every artist>, ... - <title>"`` is not unique. Any
release whose joined artist credit already runs 30 characters (classical
credits, three-way features) truncates EVERY one of its tracks to the same
string, and a dict keyed on it keeps only the task added last. So all in-flight
rows showed one sibling's percentage, ``_bump_group_progress`` summed those
mirrored values into the album roll-up, and because that roll-up only ever
rises, the inflated number stuck for the rest of the job: a 10-track album
reading 28% while three tracks were at 5%, 5% and 95%.

Rich never removes a finished task either, so a completed track's 100% went on
owning the key for every later track that collided with it.

THE FIX: the engine hands the bridge the TaskID through a ``_note_progress_task``
hook, filed under the queue row the item is being downloaded for, and the poller
reads each row through its own TaskID. Descriptions are for display.
