"""App-wide breadcrumb trail: section scoping, trim-on-revisit, crumb jumps.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The artist and browse sub-page back bars render the navHistory as a crumb
trail. Four behaviours make that trail livable and must not regress:

1. SECTION-SCOPED: the trail is the drill-in you are inside, never the tabs
   you crossed to get here. Switching tab starts a fresh trail; drilling
   extends it. Back and Forward still walk the WHOLE history across
   sections, they just stop spelling the crossing out in crumbs. This is
   what bounds the trail's depth.
2. TRIM-ON-REVISIT: arriving at a SECTION ROOT (Search, My Music, Browse
   home, Settings) already in the history cuts the history back to just
   before it. Without this, flipping between two tabs stacks Search >
   My Music > Search > ... twenty deep (reported from livetesting) and
   every crumb and Back press replays the oscillation. Deep pages are NOT
   trimmed (test_folder_back_navigation covers why).
3. The trim may only discard section roots. Anything real in the way (an
   artist page, a browse sub-page) means this was a journey, not a tab flip,
   and collapsing it made Back skip a page the user had actually opened.
4. navTo(i): clicking a crumb pops the history to that entry and restores
   it through the navBack path, so the trail truncates to the click. The
   pills pass navTo a whole-history index (crumbBase + ord), not a trail one.

The trim is debounced through a 0ms timer (it must observe the settled
state, not a half-switched one), so assertions settle the event loop first.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as test_search_results_surface_steal:
building the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak into
the rest of the suite.
