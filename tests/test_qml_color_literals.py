"""Regression guard: QML colour literals must not be 9 characters long.

THE BUG
-------
Qt parses a 9-character hex colour as **#AARRGGBB**, not #RRGGBBAA. Ten modal
scrims in Main.qml were written as ``#06070ecc`` / ``#06070ed6`` / ``#06070ef4``,
meaning "dark navy #06070e at 80/84/96% alpha". Qt read them as **alpha 0x06
(2.4%) over the blue rgb(7,14,204)**, so every modal gate in the app (download
folder, category confirm, settings reset, factory reset, folder unreachable,
FFmpeg, terms) and the login panel failed to dim the interface behind them.

The same file's other overlays get it right (``#d90d0f12`` → 85% alpha), so
this was a byte-order slip in one family of literals, not a convention.

THE FIX rewrote the ten literals as ``#cc06070e`` / ``#d606070e`` /
``#f406070e``. This guard is mechanical: any 9-character hex literal is
ambiguous to a reader and is exactly how the slip happened, so the rule is that
colours are either 7 characters (opaque) or 9 with the alpha FIRST. We cannot
tell intent from the literal alone, so instead we pin the property that broke:
no literal may have an alpha byte under 10% unless it is deliberately listed.
