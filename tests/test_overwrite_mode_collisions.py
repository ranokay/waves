"""Colliding tracks stay distinct even when the run is allowed to overwrite.

The issue-15 name claim only ran when "skip existing files" was on. Two other
paths run with it off and so bypassed it entirely:

- the setting itself turned off, which means "re-download what I already have",
  not "throw one of two distinct tracks away";
- a quality upgrade, which turns skipping off for one track on one thread
  (``_TrackedDownload._force_download``) so the old copy is replaced in place.

Both then moved with overwrite on and no claim, so a sibling track whose name
sanitizes the same way could be overwritten by them, or overwrite them.

The claim is now taken in every mode. What differs is only what a name is
compared against: an on-disk file blocks a name when skipping is on and is
meant to be replaced when it is off, while a name another download is holding
in flight is never available to anybody.
