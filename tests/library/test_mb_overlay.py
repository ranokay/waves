"""The MusicBrainz arbitration OVERLAY: how a stored verdict changes (and does
not change) what the presence slot answers.

The rules fenced off here, each the safe direction:

* The overlay may only UPGRADE an unproven verdict to proven. It never
  creates presence, never downgrades, and never touches an already-proven
  answer.
* It is inert unless BOTH the library master switch and the opt-in
  library_mb_arbiter pref are on (default off: it sends artist and title
  search terms to a third party).
* A pending lookup answers the unproven verdict immediately (the badge is
  never blocked on the network) and is deduplicated by key.
* The bulk claim gate does not read the overlay: it calls the matcher
  directly, so a third-party opinion can never cost a download.

Exercised on a bare mixin instance with everything injected, mirroring
tests/library/test_library_claim_gate.py: no Qt, no network, no files.
