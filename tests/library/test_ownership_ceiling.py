"""The ownership gate converges at each track's achievable ceiling (issue #31).

The defect: _copy_is_current ranked the copy on disk against the tier the run
ASKED for, never against the tier TIDAL can actually deliver for the release.
With the setting at HI_RES_LOSSLESS (rank 3), a release with no hi-res master
delivers LOSSLESS (rank 2), 2 >= 3 is false, and the verdict is "force" on
every run, forever: the forced fetch delivers the same LOSSLESS and re-records
the same rank, so the loop never settles, silently overwriting the identical
file each time. Album-grained (a master tier is a per-release property), which
is exactly the report's "only some albums re-download".

The fix is two ceilings. A LIVE one: callers holding the track pass what its
media_metadata_tags advertise, and a known ceiling caps the target. And a
STORED one: each record now carries the rank its run requested and the ceiling
that run saw, so even a ceiling-blind caller (ownershipOf holds only an id)
settles once a run has asked at the target, reopening only when the advertised
ceiling rises past what that run saw (a genuinely better master appeared).

Same hermetic pattern as test_atmos_ownership_scale.py: real store, real gate,
real Track objects, no Qt app or network session.
