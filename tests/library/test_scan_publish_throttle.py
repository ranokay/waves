"""Mid-scan badge publishes are throttled; the rollup is derived off-GUI.

The costs these fence off:

* Every committed flush of a running scan must not rebuild BOTH presence
  indexes from a full table read (a cold scan of a big library commits every
  200 albums, so ~90 rebuilds whose own cost grows as the table fills). Mid-scan
  partial publishes are rate-limited to one per _SCAN_PUBLISH_MIN_S; the FIRST
  commit still publishes immediately (badges light up as soon as anything is
  committed) and the scan's final publish is unconditional, so nothing
  committed is ever left unpublished.

* The artist rollup (a full pass over the album index) must not be derived
  lazily inside the synchronous artistLibraryPresence slot, on the GUI thread,
  on the first ask after every republish. Every publish precomputes it on the
  worker (_publish_index, one swap with the index itself) before
  libraryPresenceChanged fires; the slot keeps the lazy derive only as a race
  fallback, and takes it through _artist_rollup so a cache-backed index does
  not reach the whole-library pass.

The scan is driven through a fake lib whose refresh fires a burst of
committed events, over a REAL LibraryIndex's rows (the fake delegates
everything else), so build_index sees genuine data.
