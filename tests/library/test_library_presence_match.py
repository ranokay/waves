"""Unit tests for the album-presence matching core (waves.matching).

Pure-function tests: no network and no Qt runtime, imported straight from the
headless brain rather than through the GUI bridge. These are the regression
contract for the cross-catalog "do I already have this album?" check against
the scanned local library. The whole design is biased against FALSE POSITIVES,
so several cases assert a match is deliberately HIDDEN and would be a conscious
change to loosen.

Two bars are under test and they are not the same. ``present`` lights the pill
and is generous: being wrong there costs a badge. ``partial`` False is the claim
that a local copy is COMPLETE, which the UI renders as an inert already
downloaded button, so being wrong THERE costs the user a download they cannot
start. Every case below asserting ``not partial`` is asserting that stronger
bar, and loosening one is a decision about file access, not about a pill.

``partial`` is itself the AND of two independent axes with their own section
below: ``sure`` (identity, the badge's "?") and ``full`` (coverage, N OF M).
