"""The badge slots answer repeat asks from a memo, not by re-matching.

THE COST THIS FENCES OFF
------------------------
libraryAlbumPresence / libraryTrackPresence are synchronous GUI-thread slots.
Every libraryPresenceChanged republish makes ALL visible pills re-ask, and
scrolling re-asks per row, always against the same published index object,
so the matcher re-derived identical verdicts over and over inside frames.
Each slot now memoizes verdicts keyed by its arguments, valid only for the
index object they were computed against: the memo resets exactly when the
index is swapped (the same moment libraryPresenceChanged fires), so the
always-on freshness rule holds, and it is FIFO-bounded. The MusicBrainz
overlay stays OUTSIDE the album memo, so an arbitration answer landing
without an index swap still overlays on the next ask.
