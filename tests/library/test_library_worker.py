"""The library scanner process: its protocol, and the app-side launcher.

The scan must never hold the app's interpreter (the launch water dropped
frames for every sweep, probed live 2026-09-01 and 2026-09-11), so it runs
in a child process (waves.library.worker) that the bridge talks to over
pipes (waves.desktop.library_proc). Pinned here:
  * the protocol, in-process over byte streams: a scan answers with a done
    event carrying the cache's verdicts, a probe with probe_done, a bad job
    with an error event that does not end the process, quit ends it, and
    only protocol ever reaches the real stdout;
  * the launcher against the REAL child: a scan of a temp library round
    trips, progress events reach the handler, a superseded job kills the
    child and answers None, a command that cannot start disables the worker
    once (the bridge then scans in-process), and a child that dies mid-job
    hands the job back;
  * the frozen app re-executes its own binary with the flag.
