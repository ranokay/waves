"""A merged track re-saved over a copy an older Waves tagged the other way replaces it.

A "best of both" merge fetches a track from one edition (``member.id``, the
SOURCE id) and files it under another edition's slot (``waves_identity_id``).
Every build up to v0.1.21 stamped the SOURCE id into that file; today's build
stamps the identity id. A library assembled by an older Waves is therefore full
of merged tracks tagged with an id the current build no longer files them under.

With skipping off (overwrite mode, or a quality upgrade), the engine asks
``_is_own_copy`` whether the file at the destination is this item's own to
replace. Recognising ONLY the identity id would call the old copy a stranger,
step around it, and write a ``_01`` duplicate beside it: forever, since the app
never deletes a user-visible file. ``_waves_owned_ids`` widens "its own" to
both ids, and this file pins that the widening reaches the disk decision.
