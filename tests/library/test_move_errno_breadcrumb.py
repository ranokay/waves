"""The rename fast path leaves a breadcrumb when it falls back.

_move_file tries a plain rename first and drops to the copy-and-swap fallback on
any OSError. That catch is deliberately wide: it is what makes a library on a
network mount or an external drive work at all, and narrowing it to EXDEV would
undo hard-won behavior there. But it swallowed the errno, so a destination that
is read-only or out of space looked exactly like an ordinary cross-filesystem
move right up to the point the copy failed too. The errno now reaches the
breadcrumb ring, with the file named only by its name, never its path.
