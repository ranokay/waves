"""A truncated leftover must not eat a track's name forever.

A crash or a share drop between creating a file and writing it leaves a 0-byte
file under the final name. The skip gate reads that correctly, as nothing (a
0-byte file is never a finished download), so the track downloads again. The
move then read the very same file as an occupant and refused to land on it,
saying the destination belongs to another writer. Every retry, and every run
after it, repeated exactly that: the track could never be downloaded again
until the user found and removed the empty file by hand.

Related, and the same shape of silent loss: when all 99 numbered variants of a
name are taken, file_unique_suffix used to hand back the last one anyway, so
the move was refused with the same wordless failure.
