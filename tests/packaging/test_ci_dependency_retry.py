"""The CI dependency install must retry.

Every build leg installs PySide6, whose wheels are ~165MB, and PyPI does
occasionally cut a transfer short. The signing job needs every leg of the build
matrix, so one dropped connection on one runner leaves the whole release an
unsigned draft: that is what happened to v0.1.12. A bare ``poetry install``
here is therefore a release-level single point of failure, and this guard keeps
the retry from being quietly simplified away.
