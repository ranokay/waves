"""Guards for the packaged app icon.

A truncated ``icon.ico`` (a single 16x16 frame) once shipped and gave Windows a
generic taskbar icon: Nuitka brands the EXE from ``icon.ico``, and the taskbar
needs a >=32px frame it can't get from a 16-only file. These tests fail the
build if the committed icon regresses, and pin the runtime "is this icon usable"
guard so a degenerate icon can never again slip through to ``setWindowIcon``.
