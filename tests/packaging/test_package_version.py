"""The packaging metadata version must match the version the app reports.

``waves.desktop.__version__`` is the single source of truth: the in-app
updater compares it against the latest release tag, and CI refuses to build
unless the tag matches it. ``pyproject.toml`` carries its own copy for anyone
installing from source or reading the published tree, and nothing enforced the
two agreeing, so it silently fell two releases behind. This guard makes the
drift a test failure instead of something noticed at release time.
