"""CHANGELOG.md format guard.

Every release section must list its subheadings in the fixed order
Added > Changed > Fixed > Removed (any subset, but never shuffled), so the
notes read the same way in every GitHub Release. The heading text may carry
an emoji accent; only the trailing word is significant.

An issue a bullet closes must be written as a full link ("[issue #11](url)")
rather than a bare "(#11)": these notes are lifted verbatim into the Release
body and read well outside the repo, where a bare number links to nothing
and does not even say what it refers to.

A bullet also lives on a single line, however long. GitHub renders a Release
body with every newline turned into a line break, so a bullet wrapped across
source lines reaches the Releases page as one ragged fragment per source line
instead of a paragraph.
