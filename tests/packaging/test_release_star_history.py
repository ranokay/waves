"""The release script's guards, exercised on a throwaway repo.

The chart image and the README block that shows it are produced ON the public
repo by star-history.yml and exist nowhere in the private tree. release.sh
publishes a verbatim snapshot of that tree, so a release that does not copy
both off the public tip before publishing deletes them, and the published
README carries an empty "Star History" section until the workflow's next
06:00 UTC run. Every release reopens that window.

Refreshing the chart is still the workflow's job; the release must not undo it.

The same scenario covers the other fail-closed guards of the script: the
exclude list (any case, nested copies), the content scan over the tree about
to be published, and the pinned commit identity.

Every test builds a throwaway repo with a fake "public" remote and runs the
real release.sh in RELEASE_DRY_RUN mode, which stops after building the tree,
before any prompt or push.

release.sh itself is the maintainer's private release tool (untracked on
purpose -- see the .gitignore note: it publishes the tree of a ref, so a
stray `git add -A` can never sweep it into a commit). On any checkout without
it these tests cannot run and say so, instead of failing like a regression.
