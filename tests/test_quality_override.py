"""A per-item quality choice (issue #36) reaches the job it was made for, and
only that job.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
A choice made on a row's quality badge is recorded on the bridge by media id
and read by ``_download`` at the moment the row is queued, so every entry
point (a button, the owned gate's REDOWNLOAD, the library claim's DOWNLOAD
ANYWAY, a re-fetched share link, a download held by the folder or ffmpeg
gate) asks at that tier without carrying it. The row's two quality fields
(``askQuality``, the value the job pins; ``quality``, the word the drawer
states) come from the choice instead of the setting. A download does NOT
spend the choice: it stands on its item until that item is given another
tier, so the badge keeps stating the tier the copy on disk was asked at
(livetest report: a song downloaded at a chosen LOSSLESS had its badge fall
straight back to the catalog's HI-RES). A track without a choice of its own
inherits its album's.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
Method-bound stubs, no display and no session: the store accepts exactly the
four tiers and DEFAULT; ``_ask_quality_for`` answers own / inherited / none;
``_enqueue`` writes what it is handed; ``_download`` (with every gate
stubbed open) queues a row at the choice and leaves it standing, on the
duplicate-row short cut too; the ownership currency check targets the
choice, so a lower owned copy reads as an upgrade; and a bare stub without
the store falls through to the setting.
