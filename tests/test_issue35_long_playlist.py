"""Issue #35: a 200- or 501-track playlist failed "every time".

Nothing here is about playlists as such. Everything here is about SCALE: a
collection download judges itself all-or-nothing, so a per-track hazard that a
12-track album meets once in a hundred runs meets a 501-track playlist on
essentially every run. Three such hazards turned one entry into a red row over
a folder holding hundreds of songs:

* a track TIDAL no longer carries was counted as a FAILURE at the preparation
  gate, so a stale entry (which a years-old playlist always has) failed the
  whole playlist, permanently, on every retry;
* an item that RAISED unwound the entire list, discarding the honest tally of
  the other 500 and the m3u with it;
* whatever went wrong, the row said one word: "Failed".

The tests below pin each of those, plus the scale itself.
