"""A queued row's ledger says which tracks you already have, before the run.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
The ledger learned that a track was already yours only when the download
reached it: _emit_skip fired, _track_lifecycle recorded it, and the row turned
IN LIBRARY one at a time as the job walked the list. Expanding a row that had
not started yet showed every track as QUEUED, including the ones the run was
certain to skip, so the drawer could not answer the question people actually
open it to ask ("what is this download going to do?").

The expansion now predicts them: after the track list is on screen, a worker
asks the same two gates the download asks and marks the tracks the run will
find you already hold. The marks are a PREDICTION, so they wear the drawer's
prediction strength (half) until the run reaches the track and confirms it,
exactly like the tier cell's promised-vs-delivered convention.

The prediction must ask the download's question, not a similar one, or the
drawer promises a skip that never happens. What is pinned here:

* ownership skips only at equal-or-better quality: an owned copy BELOW the
  job's quality is an upgrade, and predicts nothing;
* the quality compared against is the JOB's, not the current setting, so a
  row queued at HI-RES keeps its answer when Settings moves afterwards;
* the library's tag claim rides only on a collection job with the bulk-skip
  pref on, and a DOWNLOAD ANYWAY override turns it off;
* a redownload forces every item and predicts nothing at all;
* a merge job predicts nothing (its members are filed under identity ids and
  may only be skipped at this job's own destination);
* a live event always wins over a prediction;
* the marks never touch the collapsed row's delivered rollup, which stays the
  record of what the run really did.
