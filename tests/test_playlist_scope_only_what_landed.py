"""The m3u writer may only write where this run actually put a file.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Writing the playlist REPLACES whatever ``_<Name>.m3u8`` a directory already
holds, and deliberately RETARGETS an older ``_<Name>.m3u`` spelling to replace
that instead when it finds one (so a library never ends up with two files for
one playlist). That is right for a folder this run filled, and wrong for every
other folder on the disk.

The scope was ``{p.parent for p in result_paths}``, and a result path is not
proof of a write. ``item()`` answers ``(True, <the file it found>)`` for a
track already on disk, which is correct for the m3u's CONTENTS (re-downloading
an album you already own still lists the whole album) but wrong for its scope.
With skip-existing on, which is the default, re-downloading an owned album
therefore handed the writer nothing but folders that pre-date this run, and it
replaced a playlist file it had no business touching. The folder could pre-date
Waves entirely.

The feature is off by default (``playlist_create``), so this never became a
field report; the docstring in the source claimed the scope was already bounded
to folders the run filled, which is what let it stay hidden.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The distinction is recorded where a file is actually created
(``_note_dir_filled``), not inferred at the writer from skip flags, and the
scope is narrowed in the path collection (``_dirs_this_run_filled``). The real
``playlist_populate`` writes into a real temp folder here; only the parts that
would reach the network are stood in for.
