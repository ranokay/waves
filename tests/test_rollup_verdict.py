"""The one verdict behind the DOWNLOADED / IN LIBRARY state on every album,
playlist and mix card: ``WavesBridge._rollup_verdict`` (backend.py), reached
through ``collectionOwnership`` and ``collectionOwnershipFor``.

The stake is the quality conjunct. A member is only counted as "owned" for the
roll-up when its copy is ALSO up_to_date against the current audio quality
setting. Drop that conjunct and an album saved at HIGH keeps reading "owned"
after the user raises the setting to Lossless, so the upgrade the card is
supposed to offer is never offered. Nothing else in the suite pinned it.

Two layers:

  * the pure roll-up, called unbound on a Qt-free stub whose ownershipOf is a
    plain dict lookup, one test per branch of the loop, and
  * one wire test through the REAL ownershipOf on a WavesBridge carcass with a
    real OwnershipStore, so the stored quality_rank is what decides the verdict
    (not a dict the test invented).

These import WavesBridge, so they collect only in the full runtime venv
(PySide6 present), like tests/test_ownership_bridge.py.
