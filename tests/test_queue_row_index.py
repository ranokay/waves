"""A queue progress tick finds its own row, and finds the RIGHT one.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Issue #24: the app got heavier the longer a batch ran. Progress arrives per
delivered segment, dozens a second per active download, and the handler used to
walk the whole model looking for its qid. Nothing ever removed a finished row,
so that walk grew all session and ran thousands of times a second on the GUI
thread. It is now a qid -> row map, rebuilt in the pass that already recounts
the groups.

That trade is only safe if the map is never wrong, and the ways it could go
wrong are all silent: the partition MOVES rows, promoteCompleted moves one to
index 0, and the reconcile removes rows outright. A stale entry would not throw,
it would paint one album's progress onto another album's bar. So this drives the
real model through all three and checks, after each, that every qid resolves to
the row that actually holds it, that a real signal from the bridge lands on the
right row, and that a deliberately corrupted map heals itself instead of lying.

Also pinned: a row leaving the queue takes its expanded track list with it.
That map is copied wholesale on every live tick, so leaking one entry per
finished album is the same lag by another route.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS like the other Main.qml scenarios: building the bridge
installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
