"""Shared test doubles for the WavesBridge unit tests.

The bridge tests are Qt-free: they bind the real, unbound ``WavesBridge`` methods
onto a minimal stand-in and drive them with fakes instead of a live QObject, a
QThreadPool, or an event loop. Two of those fakes were copy-pasted into ~10 test
files, and had already drifted into two spellings of the same ``_Signal`` and
several near-identical ``_InlinePool`` copies. They live here now as the single
source of truth; import them with ``from conftest import _Signal, _InlinePool``.

Deliberately NOT centralized:
  * ``_Stub`` stays per-file. It is not one fake but many: each test's stand-in
    carries exactly the state that test's bound methods read and write, so a
    shared version would be a grab-bag, not a contract.
  * A couple of purpose-built variants keep their own copy where the extra
    behavior is the point (e.g. an _InlinePool that counts ``start()`` calls, or
    a signal double that records single values under a different name).
