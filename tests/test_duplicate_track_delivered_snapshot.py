"""A collection may list the same track twice, and both copies run at once.

TIDAL allows a playlist to carry one track at two positions. With two or more
workers both occurrences are in flight together, and the delivered-quality
snapshot each one captures in _get_track_stream_info used to be filed under the
bare track id: one slot for two items.

Worker A writes its file and only claims its snapshot in item()'s epilogue,
after the deliberate inter-download delay. In that window worker B's
post-stream existing-file check finds A's file and drops "the" snapshot, which
by then is B's own capture sitting on top of A's. A's epilogue then finds
nothing, its done event carries no quality, and _record_ownership writes no
row: the track that really landed never enters the ledger, so it never reads
owned and every later run fetches the stream again just to skip it again.

The snapshot is now keyed by the worker thread as well as the track id.
