"""A library built before 0.1.17 keeps its album folders on the SHIPPED settings.

The layout guard is asked one level up as well: a collection's own folder is
baked into the item template before any item is queued, so the folder has to be
chosen while the collection is still an album. The trouble is what an album can
answer. A template's tokens are filled in by the thing being formatted, and the
shipped album template opens with {artist_name}, which only a track can answer,
so the album-level spelling still carried a literal "{artist_name}" segment. The
folder tested for existence therefore contained that literal text, no such
folder is ever on disk, every library looked new, and a pre-0.1.17 album got a
second, tidy-spelled folder beside the one it was already filed in. On defaults,
which is where nearly everyone is.

A template topped with {album_artist} (a question an album CAN answer) never had
the problem, which is why this went unnoticed: the guard worked in every test
that spelled the artist out.

The folders compared are now the ones an item of the collection actually lands
in, so the guard fires on the shipped template too.
