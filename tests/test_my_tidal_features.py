"""Unit coverage for the My Tidal / download-folder / cover-size changes.

These pin the pure decision logic that the QML surfaces drive:
- the download-folder gate (blank vs the legacy default vs a real folder),
- the My Tidal sort -> tidalapi order-enum mapping,
- the separate cover.jpg size resolution (and its reuse-vs-refetch shortcut).
