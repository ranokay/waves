"""The ARTISTS SHOW ALL / SHOW LESS label needs artists to label.

THE BUG WE ARE FENCING OFF
--------------------------
Every capped section on the search page hides its SHOW ALL toggle when the
section is empty, because the strip, the grid and the header all gate on
``sectionVisible(name, count)``. The ARTISTS toggle did not: it asked only
whether the view was the mixed All one and whether the row was expanded or
overflowing.

``searchArtistsExpanded`` is pref-backed (``search_sec_artists_expanded``), so
it comes back true at launch for anyone who has ever expanded the ARTISTS row.
With no search run there are no artists, the strip and the grid are correctly
gone, and the toggle was the only piece of the section left: a lone SHOW LESS
floating over an empty Search tab. Clicking it wrote the pref false, so it
vanished and did not come back, which is what made it look like a phantom.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The toggle carries the same count gate its section-mates get from
sectionVisible. The positive leg matters as much as the negative one: a guard
that hid the label unconditionally would also pass the empty case, so this
pins that one artist in the model brings the expanded row's SHOW LESS back.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as the other QML scenarios: building
the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak into the suite.
