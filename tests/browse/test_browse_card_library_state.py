"""A browse card has to say what your library holds, without being hovered.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Everywhere else the download control is a full-width button that can spell
out ALBUM IN LIBRARY. On a browse card it is one half of a pill riding on
the artwork, and that pill only rises under the cursor. So a shelf of
albums said nothing at all about what was already on disk: a record owned
in full looked exactly like one never heard of, and the only way to find
out was to open the page.

Two things answer it now, and they answer different questions:

* the library PILL sits on the artwork and does not wait for a hover, so a
  shelf reads at a glance (this is the half a hover-gated control cannot do);
* the strip's download HALF carries the verdict in the same four colours the
  full button uses, so what the click will do is never a surprise.

Both are pinned here, along with the two ways they must stay quiet: a
playlist or mix card has no album identity and must never wear an album's
badge, and an album that is not in the library must look exactly as it
always did.

Runs in a SUBPROCESS for the same reason as the other Main.qml scenarios:
building the bridge installs process-global handlers that must not leak
into the rest of the suite.
