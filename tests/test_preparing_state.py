"""A click that is parked behind a prerequisite must not look like a download.

Three entry points answer a click before anything is queued: a metadata
re-fetch (the object aged out of the browse registry), a playlist-folder-tree
warm (``{folder_path}`` would resolve blind), and the best-of-both edition
scan. All three used to publish "running" for the immediate button feedback,
which drew the progress bar: a dot matrix at 0% for a download that had not
started, torn down again a moment later when ``_download`` published "queued".
Clicking download on a Browse playlist showed the bar flash and snap to the
queued pill.

They publish "preparing" instead, which the buttons draw exactly like queued,
so the hand-over to a real queue row is the cancel X arriving and nothing else.
