"""The QML actually parses, and a QML error FAILS the suite.

THE HOLE THIS FILLS
-------------------
Twenty-five scenario tests boot Main.qml in a subprocess, and every one of them
answers a QML load failure with ``return _EXIT_PRECONDITION``, which the parent
turns into ``pytest.skip``. That is right for them: they cannot tell a broken
Main.qml from a machine with no working offscreen Qt, and a scenario that
cannot run must not masquerade as a scenario that passed.

The consequence was that NOTHING failed. A syntax error in Main.qml took the
whole suite green, twenty-five skips deep, because no test anywhere asserted
that the QML loads at all. This file is that assertion, and it is the only one
allowed to be strict: if Qt itself is missing it skips like the others, but
once an engine exists, a QML file that will not load is a failure and its
errors are printed.

Engine warnings count too. A QML warning is a binding that silently did
nothing at runtime (an undefined property, a type error in a handler), which is
exactly the class of defect a headless load can catch and a human clicking
around usually cannot.
