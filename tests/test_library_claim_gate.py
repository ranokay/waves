"""The library scan's bulk claim gate only fires where it is meant to.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
"Bulk downloads skip what you have" (library_bulk_skip) is the second gate in
the download path that can skip a track nothing else would, and the first one
fed by TAG GUESSES rather than exact identifiers, so its carve-offs matter
even more than the duplicate-recording gate's:

* Only injected at all for collection jobs (the bridge passes library_claim
  None for a single-track click, which is an explicit ask): covered by the
  None-callable case here.
* Never ahead of ownership. An owned record's verdict stands: 'skip' stays
  'skip', and 'force' (a genuine quality upgrade) must never be talked down
  to a skip by a tag match.
* Never inside a "best of both" merge. A merge assembles one complete folder,
  and the claim points at the library, not this job's destination. A merge
  member is recognised by ``waves_identity_id``.
* A claim lookup failure never gates: downloading twice beats not
  downloading at all.

The verdict method is exercised directly on a bare instance (no Qt, no
network, no files): everything it consults is injected, mirroring
test_duplicate_recording_gate.py.
