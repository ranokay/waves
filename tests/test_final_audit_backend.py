"""The final pre-release audit of 2026-08-31, the bridge's half.

The whole-file audit's fix round left the held-download path (a download
waiting for an unreachable download folder to come back) able to outlive every
press that ends a download, and able to lose the very state its hold was taken
to protect. Each test below states the user-visible sequence it prevents, and
each was checked against the unfixed code first: reverting its fix turns the
test red.

  1  STOP, CANCEL and the clears left a held download to start itself again
  2  a held REDOWNLOAD came back unforced and skipped every file
  3  an abandoned hold left its best-of-both plan for a later plain click
  4  a clear credited a failure against a row that had just started running
  5  the motion-background sweep deleted whatever else was in its folder
  6  a saturated pool reported as idle in every line of a diagnostics export
