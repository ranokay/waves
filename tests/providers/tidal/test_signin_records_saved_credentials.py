"""A completed sign-in is recorded as saved, so the app can re-authenticate.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
``login_finalize`` writes the credentials file, but the flag that says a saved
sign-in exists was set only in ``Tidal.__init__``: a command-line assumption,
where the process signs in once and exits and the next run re-reads the file on
the way up. A window that stays open does not get a next run, so after a first
launch on a new install (or a sign-out and back in) the session worked while the
flag stayed False.

``login_token`` opens on that flag. Every later re-authentication in the same
run therefore answered False without attempting anything, and the one that
re-authenticates is the Dolby Atmos switch: it swaps in the Atmos credentials
and signs in again. So every Atmos track in every download failed for the rest
of the run, printing "Atmos session authentication failed", and only quitting
the app fixed it. A restart-to-refresh dependency is exactly what this app does
not do.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
The real ``WavesTidal`` finalizes a sign-in against a real credentials file in
a temp folder, and the symptom is then reproduced end to end through the REAL
``waves.config.Tidal.switch_to_atmos_session`` and the REAL
``WavesTidal.login_token``. Only tidalapi's own session object is a stand-in,
and it counts how many times it was actually asked to sign in, so "returned
False without trying" is distinguishable from "tried and failed".
