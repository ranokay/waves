"""The "Download delay" setting actually reaches the engine.

THE BUG
-------
``download_delay`` is a Waves setting: it appears in ``_FLAG_FIELDS``, on the
Settings page under Downloads, and its two companion fields "Minimum/Maximum
download delay (s)" were live. The flag itself was never read by anything in
``waves/``.

The engine takes it as a PARAMETER and relies on the caller to forward it.
Waves forwarded nothing, so each dispatch fell back to a different default and
the toggle was inert in both directions:

  * a collection got ``items()``' default of True, so turning the delay OFF
    still slept a random 3 to 5 seconds after every written track, roughly
    27 seconds of pure sleep on a 20-track album;
  * a single track got ``item()``' default of False, so turning the delay ON
    never delayed anything;
  * the "best of both" fan-out stands in for ``items()`` and forwarded nothing
    either, so the setting was honored on a plain album and ignored on a merged
    one.

THE FIX forwards ``settings.data.download_delay`` at all three dispatch sites.
