"""A failed artist lookup must never be reported as a finished edition scan.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Clicking DOWNLOAD on an album with the best-of-both preference on runs a quiet
scan first: it asks the album's artist for every release bucket and keeps the
ones that are other editions of the same album. That scan answers the caller
with a list AND a "did I actually manage to look" flag.

The flag used to start out True and could only ever be turned off inside the
bucket loop, which never runs when the artist could not be fetched at all. The
artist fetch swallows every failure (a dropped session, a rate limit) and hands
back nothing, and an album carrying no artist id is never even asked. Both of
those paths returned "one edition, scan complete", so the app told the user as
a fact "Only one edition of this album; downloading it" and quietly fetched the
plain album. On a release that really does have a richer deluxe sibling, best
of both was lost and nothing on screen said so.

The scan now reports incomplete whenever it could not read the artist, and the
click turns that into the honest "Could not scan editions, try again" the
discography path already gives for a half-read scan.

WHAT IS PINNED HERE
-------------------
* a swallowed artist failure means incomplete, and the album itself is still
  the single edition returned (the list half of the answer must not change);
* an album with no artist id is incomplete too, and nothing is even asked of
  the session;
* a clean scan is still complete and still finds every sibling edition sharing
  the album's merge key (and only those), naming the clicked album once even
  though the artist's own bucket hands it back too;
* a failing bucket is still incomplete with whatever the working buckets did
  find, whether it is the first bucket or the last one (pre-existing
  behaviour, pinned here as well, and pinned at both ends: "I already found
  something, so call it a finished scan" is the same lie in a smaller coat);
* an artist that answered every bucket and simply has no other edition is
  complete, so this fix cannot turn a genuinely single-edition album into a
  false alarm;
* the user-visible consequence: with the artist unreadable, the click does NOT
  say "Only one edition of this album" and does NOT queue the album as a plain
  download, and with the artist readable it still says exactly that.

Everything below is observed from the real methods (the real
``_sibling_editions``, the real ``_get_artist``, the real
``downloadAlbumBestOfBoth``) bound onto a bare ``WavesBridge`` carcass. Nothing
is asserted by construction.

One thing is worth stating plainly. The click's worker funnels every failure
into one ``except Exception``, so "the app refused" on its own does not prove
the refusal came from the scan coming up short: a worker that died on its way
to the scan would look identical on screen. The two click tests therefore also
watch the session traffic and the failure the app wrote down, so an unrelated
crash cannot wear the honest refusal's clothes.
