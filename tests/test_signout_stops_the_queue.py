"""Signing out ends the downloads first, on the session that started them.

Every job is handed to the download pool at the moment it is queued, and the
signed-in check sits at that moment, never inside the running job. So signing
out used to leave the whole backlog running against the account being signed
out of: it failed one item at a time, for as long as the queue was, which is
exactly what someone switching to a second account is trying to escape
(issue #30).

The stop is the STOP button's own, so nothing is lost: the rows stay, marked
stopped, and RETRY ALL picks them up on whichever account signs in next (the
Stopped section, issue #27). What this pins is the order. The session object is
destroyed a few lines later, so the aborts have to be set before it goes.
