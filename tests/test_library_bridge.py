"""Glue tests for the bridge's local-library scan family (bridge_library.py).

Qt-free: the mixin's methods are bound onto a bare stub with an inline pool, so
the scan, the source resolution, the presence answers and the signal traffic are
tested without a QObject or an event loop. The watcher half (Qt-only) is covered
by test_library_watch_classify.py; the scanner itself by test_library_index.py.

    can DECLINE a fetch, and it can do NOTHING else.

    The engine's own skip decisions (ownership store, skip_existing, the ISRC
    scan) run on exact identifiers Waves recorded itself. Presence reaches the
    download path in exactly one shape: the bulk claim gate
    (library_bulk_skip), which answers "don't fetch this" through callables the
    bridge injects at enqueue time. A claim can therefore only ever cost a
    re-click, never a file: the engine module itself still never pulls in the
    matcher, so no code that writes, moves or overwrites can consult a tag
    guess, and _claim_verdict (tested in test_library_claim_gate.py) only maps
    a claim to "skip", never to the overwriting "force". The QML side keeps its
    click-through (gold MAYBE IN LIBRARY, DOWNLOAD ANYWAY), which registers an
    override so a claim is never the end of the conversation.

    Pinned by IMPORT CLOSURE, not by grepping for a substring. The substring
    version read download.py for the literal "waves.matching", which survives
    `from waves import matching`, `import waves.matching as m`, an
    `importlib.import_module` call, and reaching the matcher through any third
    module. Importing the engine in a clean interpreter and looking at what
    landed in sys.modules survives all of those, because it asks what the code
