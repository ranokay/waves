"""A best-of-both merge leaves the album's .m3u8 behind, exactly as a plain
album download does.

WHAT THIS FENCES OFF
--------------------
Settings > Files > "Create .m3u8 playlist" promises a playlist file for every
downloaded album. The engine keeps that promise at the end of ``items()``: it
collects the landed paths in track order and hands them to
``playlist_populate``. The bridge's best-of-both merge stands in for
``items()`` over an explicit track list, fanned out through ``item()`` on its
own pool, and it stopped after the pool: every track landed, the queue row read
done, and no ``_<Album>.m3u8`` was ever written. The same album downloaded with
the merge preference off got its playlist. No retry ever produced the file,
because a retry only re-ran the same fan-out.

THE FIX
-------
The step ``items()`` ends with is now an engine method,
``Download._playlist_for_collection`` (the setting gate, the name, the
sort-by-number decision and the ``playlist_populate`` call), fed by
``Download._landed_paths`` (the submission-order path collection that
``_process_download_futures`` already did). ``items()`` calls both; the merge
fan-out calls both. One decision, so the two paths cannot drift on what the
file is called, what it lists or in which order.

HOW THIS STAYS FIXED
--------------------
A real ``Download`` (its network-touching ``__init__`` skipped) with the REAL
``playlist_populate``, a real temp album folder, and the REAL
``WavesBridge._download_merge_plan`` as an unbound method. ``item()`` is the
only stand-in on the merge path: it writes a real file where the engine would
and returns the engine's ``(ok, path)`` contract. Most assertions read the
folder; the few that need the arguments the playlist writer was handed record
the real ``playlist_populate`` and still let it write.
