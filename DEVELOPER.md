# Developer guide

A short orientation for anyone who wants to read or change the Waves code.
Ten minutes here saves an afternoon of reverse-engineering.

                     reads plug in here; each provider's engine stays behind it
```

One process, one window, one bridge object. QML never talks to TIDAL and
Python never builds UI.

## Package layout and the engine/UI seam

Waves began as a fork of Tidaler and now maintains its own engine: the
download engine modules at the top of the `waves` package descend from the
upstream code (with many fixes of our own), and everything UI-specific lives
in `waves/waves_ui/`. The engine/UI split is a hard seam: engine modules stay
close to their inherited shape and UI-owned behavior lands in `waves_ui`
subclasses and helpers, which keeps the engine easy to audit. User-facing
state lives in its own `Waves` folder, independent of the package name
(`~/.config/Waves` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Waves` on macOS,
`%APPDATA%\Waves` on Windows; see `__config_dirname__` in
`waves/__init__.py`).

## Threading model

- The **GUI thread** runs Qt's event loop, all QML, and every signal
  handler. Bridge state (`_objs`, caches) is only mutated here; `_queue`
  rows are also touched by download workers under `_queue_lock`, and QML
  hears about it through the coalesced GUI-thread flush
  (`_flush_queue_changes`).
- **`threadpool`** runs short blocking work: login, search, album tracks,
  artist pages, browse pages.
- **`dl_pool`** runs the one download job in flight (queue items are
  serial; track-level parallelism lives inside the engine's per-collection
  executor, sized by the "concurrent downloads" setting). Rows behind it
  wait as lightweight specs until `_pump_queue` builds their job, so a
  backlog of any size holds no Workers, no Download objects and no relays.

The pattern for anything slow, used by every slot in `backend.py`:

```python
@Slot(str)
def doThing(self, arg: str) -> None:      # called from QML
    def work():
        result = something_blocking(arg)   # worker thread
        self.thingLoaded.emit(result)      # Qt queues this to the GUI thread
    self.threadpool.start(Worker(work))
```

Signals emitted from a worker are delivered on the GUI thread automatically
(queued connection), which is why the bridge never needs locks around
QML-facing state.

## Where state lives

| State                                                     | Owner                                                                    | Why                                                |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| View routing, filters, scroll positions, preview UI state | `Main.qml` root properties                                               | UI transients; die with the window                 |
| Download queue, live tidalapi objects, page caches        | `WavesBridge` (see its class docstring)                                  | Must survive view switches and feed multiple views |
| User preferences                                          | engine `Settings` (`settings.json`) plus `waves.json` for GUI-only prefs | Persisted across runs                              |
| Login token                                               | engine `Tidal` (`token.json`)                                            | Owned by the engine                                |

## Worked example: adding a feature end to end

Say you want a "share link" action on album cards:

1. **Bridge slot** (`backend.py`): add `@Slot(str)` `def shareAlbum(self,
album_id)`, look the album up in `self._objs["album"]`, do the work on
   `self.threadpool` via `Worker`, emit a new signal with the result.
2. **Signal**: declare it near the other signals with a comment saying what
   it carries and when it fires (see `BRIDGE.md` in `waves/waves_ui/`).
3. **QML**: add a `function onShareAlbum(...)` handler inside Main.qml's
   `Connections { target: waves }` block, and call `waves.shareAlbum(id)`
   from the card's control line.
4. **Conventions**: reuse the shared components (ArtistLinks, DotMatrix,
   button spec constants on the root item) so the new surface matches the
   rest of the app, and keep any dynamic `Text` as `Text.PlainText` (a test
   enforces this).

## Testing and verification

```bash
poetry run pytest                     # unit tests, incl. the QML guards
poetry run python -m waves.waves_ui   # run the app from source
make gui-waves                        # Nuitka build -> dist/waves.app
```

### Test groups

The suite splits into groups with their own commands. Do not run groups
concurrently, and keep the machine idle while one runs: the QML scenarios are
timing-sensitive under load. Counts and runtimes below are as of 2026-09-17
(macOS arm64, offscreen Qt); the budget is the limit the group must stay
within on this host.

| Group                                                  | Command                                                                                                              |  Cases |                   Budget (measured) |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -----: | ----------------------------------: |
| fast (no Qt, ffmpeg, slow, integration or account)     | `pytest --doctest-modules -rs -q -m "not qml and not ffmpeg and not slow and not account and not integration" tests` | ~4,194 |                      < 1 min (37 s) |
| quick QML (the heaviest boots skipped)                 | `pytest --doctest-modules -rs -q -m "qml and not slow and not account" --require-qml tests`                          |    ~91 |                < 5 min (4 min 12 s) |
| default (all but the live account tests; `make test`)  | `pytest --doctest-modules -rs -m "not account" tests`                                                                | ~4,354 |               < 10 min (6 min 48 s) |
| strict (the merge gate; default plus `--require-qml`)  | `pytest --doctest-modules -rs --require-qml -m "not account" tests`                                                  | ~4,354 | < 10 min (6 min 51 s to 9 min 21 s) |
| ffmpeg (assumes ffmpeg on PATH; `-rs` shows the skips) | `pytest --doctest-modules -rs -q -m "ffmpeg and not account" tests`                                                  |    ~56 |                      < 1 min (11 s) |
| live account (never in CI; needs credentials)          | `WAVES_ACCOUNT_TESTS=1 pytest -q -m account tests`                                                                   |      4 |                                 n/a |

`--require-qml` turns a missing Qt into a failure instead of a silent skip of
the whole QML half. The `slow` marker names the heaviest QML boots (each case
at least 8 s) and always sits beside `qml`, so `qml and not slow` covers the
GUI surface without them. `integration` tests (nested runners, process
boundaries) have no quick group of their own; run them through strict.
`make test-fast`, `make test-qml`, `make test-strict` and `make test-ffmpeg`
wrap the first four commands.

Updating a checkout across the package rename (`tidaler/` to `waves/`)? Run
`pip uninstall tidaler` in the old venv, then re-run `poetry install` (or
`pip install -e ".[gui]"`). A stale editable install keeps `import tidaler`
resolving against dead code, and without the `waves` distribution installed
the app treats the run as a dev environment and opens against the separate
`Waves-dev` config folder, which looks like being signed out.

The QML plain-text guard test fails if any dynamic `Text` in Main.qml can
render rich text (remote strings must never inject markup).

The launch water (the wave video behind the launch screen) shares the GUI
thread with the interface, and the GUI thread waits for the interpreter lock
whenever any Python runs, so a job dispatched before `bootRevealed` competes
with the picture for every frame it holds the lock. Two things keep it
smooth: `tests/test_boot_quiet_window.py` allowlists every job that may run
before the reveal (a new boot job fails the test until it is added with its
reason), and `tools/launch_probe.py` measures a real launch with Qt's own
render-loop log, no Python on the measured path, and prints a verdict:

```bash
poetry run python tools/launch_probe.py        # 12 s, gaps over 45 ms
```

Run it twice (the first launch after a build is colder) before and after
anything that touches the boot path. The library walk itself runs in a child
process (`waves/library_worker.py`, started by `waves/waves_ui/library_proc.py`)
for the same reason: off the GUI thread was never enough, off the interpreter
is what the picture needs.

`tests/conftest.py` points `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` at a throwaway directory at
import time, before any test module loads, so the whole suite (subprocess
scenarios included) resolves its config out of a sandbox. Never resolve a path
from `path_config_base()` in a test without that sandbox: a `WavesBridge`
writes `waves.json` in `__init__`, so an unsandboxed test overwrites the real
settings of whoever runs the suite. Patching a loader to return defaults is not
enough while the writer still knows the real path.
