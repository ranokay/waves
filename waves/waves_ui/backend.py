"""Bridge between the download engine and the Waves QML UI.

Everything the QML layer needs is exposed here as Qt properties, slots and
signals on a single ``WavesBridge`` QObject. The bridge wraps the existing
backend objects (``Settings``, ``Tidal``, ``Download``) and runs blocking
calls (login, search, downloads, artist pages) on a ``QThreadPool`` so the UI
never freezes.

Search results are grouped by type and flattened into plain dicts carrying
cover-art URLs, popularity and inline metadata, so the QML stays declarative
and never touches a tidalapi object directly.

    """Is the copy already on disk as good as what a download queued now would
    write, so that fetching it again would achieve nothing?

    The tier alone cannot answer that for a Dolby Atmos copy. TIDAL serves
    Atmos only through a session pinned to ATMOS_REQUEST_QUALITY
    (constants.py), so an Atmos file arrives at that tier whatever the audio
    quality setting says. Ranked on the stereo scale it is judged stale against
    a tier it can never be granted, and stale means force: re-fetch and
    overwrite the identical file on every download, forever, while the button
    never leaves DOWNLOAD and the album card never reads as downloaded.

    An Atmos copy is therefore current for a job that would fetch Atmos, full
    stop. The request tier is a constant this app cannot raise, so the next
    fetch would ask for exactly what this one already got. If TIDAL's own
    answer changes, that is not something an ownership gate can see; Redownload
    is the way to ask for it again.

    Everything else is the tier comparison, unchanged. Note what is deliberately
    NOT here: turning Atmos on does not make an owned stereo copy read as stale.
    A track can hold an Atmos copy and a stereo copy at once (different codecs,
    different file extensions, so two rows), and ownership_of answers with the
    highest tier among them, which is the stereo one. Forcing on that mismatch
    would re-fetch the Atmos file the user already has, on every download,
    which is the very loop above wearing the other mask.

    That last paragraph holds only while the stereo copy sits AT OR ABOVE the
    target. Below it, the tier comparison forces on its own account, the fetch
    returns Atmos to a second path, and ownership_of goes on answering with the
    stereo row because it orders by rank, so the verdict stays "force" and the
    button never settles. Closing that needs a mode-aware store query and a
    mode-aware bridge cache: ownershipOf holds an id and a record, never the
    track's audio modes, so the gate and the button cannot even be told the same
    thing today. Redownload is the way out meanwhile. Do not "fix" it by making
    an Atmos-wanting job read any record as current: that makes a below-target
    stereo copy read as current too, and splits the gate from the button
    permanently.

    The tier comparison itself converges at each track's achievable ceiling
    (issue #31): a release TIDAL has no hi-res master for delivers LOSSLESS
    however high the setting asks, so ranking that copy against the raw target
    forced a re-download of the identical file on every run, forever, exactly
    the loop the Atmos clause above closes for its own arm. ``ceiling_rank``
    is the best rank TIDAL advertises for the item RIGHT NOW (pass None when
    unknown, never a guess): a known ceiling caps the target, so owning the
    best that exists counts as current. And a copy served by a run that
    already ASKED at this target or better (the record's requested_rank)
    counts as current even without a live ceiling, unless the advertised
    ceiling has risen past what that run saw (the record's ceiling_rank), in
    which case a genuinely better master exists and the upgrade reopens. That
    second clause is what lets a ceiling-blind caller (ownershipOf holds only
    an id) settle off the stored ranks instead of flashing an upgrade forever.

    What the request alone must never settle is a DEGRADED delivery: a run that
    asked high enough and was served below the ceiling it saw at the time
    (TIDAL has handed back less than it advertised, issue #2). The record then
    holds a rank under its own stored ceiling, and settling on the request
    would freeze that copy as current for good: the button reads DOWNLOADED,
    every later run skips it, and raising the quality setting does nothing.
    That is the one case where the stored ranks disagree with each other, and
    the disagreement is the answer."""

        Also the seam where this job's pinned audio quality is applied. The
        engine calls this holding tidal.stream_lock, which serialises every
        stream fetch in the process, so writing the shared session's quality
        here cannot cross another job's fetch.

        An Atmos fetch is left ENTIRELY alone: nothing captured, nothing
        written, nothing restored. It carries its own session and its own
        request quality, and the switch that sets them runs inside the super()
        call below, i.e. after this point. Capturing here and restoring in the
        finally would therefore write the stereo tier back over that switch,
        and switch_to_atmos_session only sets the Atmos quality when it has to
        build the session, so every later Atmos track in the run would be
        fetched at the stereo tier instead.

        For a normal track the capture happens AFTER restore_normal_session,
        which re-reads the setting when it rebuilds a normal session, so what
        the finally puts back is that session's own quality rather than
        whatever an earlier Atmos track left behind.

        That restore is a re-authentication when the session is in Atmos mode,
        and it can fail (a network flap). A failed restore leaves the session
        marked Atmos, so the engine's OWN restore inside super() does not
        early-return: it rewrites the session quality from the live setting,
        over any pin written here, and if its re-login then succeeds the track
        is fetched at today's setting instead of the job's. That is the exact
        harm the pin exists to prevent, and it is silent (the ledger records
        the real tier and agrees with itself). So a failed restore is not
        pinned over: the item is answered the way the engine answers the same
        failure, no stream, which item() counts as a failed track that a retry
        picks up. One track retried beats one track written at the wrong

    ``recs_of`` maps album -> list[_MergeRec]; ``rank_of`` maps an album OR a track
    to an int audio rank. Returns ``(identity_album, plan, reason)`` where
    ``identity_album`` is the most complete edition and ``plan`` is a list of
    ``_PlanEntry`` over that edition's track layout, each shared track sourced from
    the highest-quality edition that carries it, exclusives from the complete
    edition. On a decline it returns ``(None, None, reason)`` so the caller can
    both fall back and SAY WHY: a merge that quietly declines is otherwise
    indistinguishable from one that had nothing to do.

    ``rank_of`` is asked about the individual RECORDING, not the release. An
    album's advertised tier is the ceiling over all its tracks, so ranking the
    release borrowed every shared song from an edition that happened to carry one
    hi-res bonus mix, and could even swap in a LOWER-tier recording than the
    template's own.

    SAFETY INVARIANT (never lose a song): the merged album is built from the
    template's track list, so any track that lives only on a *non-template* edition
    would be silently dropped. We therefore refuse to merge unless the template
    contains every track of every edition in the group, if even one edition has a

    """The single object exposed to QML as the ``waves`` context property.

    State model at a glance (each field is documented where it is created in
    ``__init__``; this is the map of how they relate):

    * ``_objs``: per-kind buckets (album/artist/track/playlist/video/mix) of
      the *live tidalapi objects* behind whatever QML is currently showing.
      QML only ever holds plain dicts and ids; when it asks to download or
      expand something, the slot looks the real object up here by id. A new
      search replaces the buckets, and each bucket is FIFO-capped at
      ``_MAX_OBJS_PER_BUCKET``, so an id can be evicted; download slots
      recover by re-fetching the object by id (``_mediaRefetched``).
    * ``_queue``: the download queue as a list of plain dicts
      ``{qid, media_id, type, title, status, prog, ...}``. Every mutation
      marks its rows dirty and goes through ``_emit_queue()``; a GUI-thread
      flush then ships only the rows concerned via the three delta signals
      (``queueRowsAdded`` / ``queueRowsChanged`` / ``queueRowsRemoved``),
      with ``queueChanged`` kept for the rare full resync. A queued row
      waits as a ``_JobSpec`` (plus ``_job_objs``, its live object, kept for
      RETRY); ``_pump_queue`` builds the actual job when the pool is free,
      one at a time, so the running job alone holds the per-job companions
      keyed by qid: ``_job_aborts`` (cancel it without stopping the rest),
      ``_job_signals`` (the GUI-thread progress relay), and ``_job_tracks``
      (per-track rows behind the queue drawer expansion, kept for terminal
      rows until their row leaves).
    * Session caches: ``_lib_cache`` (My Tidal pages + scroll offsets),
      ``_browse_root_cache``/``_browse_pages`` (editorial pages), and
      ``_artist_cache`` (stale-while-revalidate artist pages). A snapshot of
      these is persisted to ``page_cache.json`` so the next launch starts
      warm; the file is account-tagged and deleted on logout.
    * Threading: slots that hit the network wrap the work in ``Worker`` and
      run it on ``threadpool`` (search/metadata) or ``dl_pool`` (downloads,
      sized by the concurrency setting), then hand results back to the GUI
      thread by emitting signals (Qt auto-queues cross-thread emissions).
      Nothing below ever touches QML state from a worker thread.

        A prediction, and it must be the SAME question the download itself
        asks or the drawer promises a skip that never happens: this mirrors
        _TrackedDownload._claim_decision gate for gate. A redownload forces

        with the bulk-skip pref on, and which carries no DOWNLOAD ANYWAY
        override, exactly as the engine wires it.

        The tier and the claim gate are both the JOB's, not today's settings: a
        row queued at HI-RES keeps asking for HI-RES however Settings moves
        afterwards, and the claim gate is pinned the same way (see
        _job_library_skip), so a prediction read off the live settings would
        disagree with the run.

        A merge job predicts nothing at all: its tracks are filed under
        identity ids and may only be skipped when the owned copy sits in that
        job's own destination folder, which is a question this cannot answer

        per-track audio is whatever its source edition offers) and re-tagged as a
        member of ``identity_album`` via :func:`_as_member_of`. This mirrors how
        ``Download.items`` fans tracks out on a pool and reports list-level
        progress, but over an explicit track list. What ``items()`` does around
        that fan-out (collect the landed paths in track order, then write the
        album's playlist file) it does through the engine's own methods, so a
        merged album's playlist is named, ordered and scoped like a plain one's.

        What it deliberately does NOT replicate from ``items()``: the list-name
        emit (nothing in the bridge listens to it), the "Finished list"
        breadcrumb (the job worker logs the outcome), and the empty-list
        progress emit (the worker emits 100 itself).

        is counted and the shortfall judged at the end. ``items()`` used to
        fail the whole job on the first crash, which is what threw away the

        it, its FFmpeg backend blocks on ``setPosition``, which kills the

        ``whole`` remuxes the entire track (every production caller passes
        True: the scrubber, and the gapless promote where the preview becomes
        the player, both need the full stream); ``whole=False`` truncates to a

        managed binary path into ``path_binary_ffmpeg``. ``Settings`` is a

        loses FLAC extraction and video conversion until they notice, and a

        an m4a's duration is skipped (the issue #2 symptom it exists to fix) and
        a FLAC extraction runs with an empty executable and fails outright.

        no save site calls it. Saves fire from thoroughly ordinary places, a
        "Don't ask again" tick, the first album to land on a network share, a
        folder becoming reachable again, so this sat in the middle of any
        download that ran long enough.

        What goes to disk is the user's real preference; what stays in memory is
        what the running download was built with. Both, not one or the other.

        Serialised, because those save sites run on the GUI thread, on download
        workers and on the keep-warm daemon: two overlapping saves would put
        each other's borrowed values back and strand the singleton on them.

        Every save must go through here. Callers that need a specific ordering
        around the restores (``applySettings``) do them explicitly instead, under
        ``_settings_save_lock`` all the same, and follow with ``_init_download``
        so the managed path is re-injected. Holding the lock is not optional
        there: the restore and the write are separate statements, and this
        method's ``finally`` puts the managed path back, so a save from here
        landing between them would be serialised by that write."""
