import QtQuick

// The loading hint: what a page shows while its payload is still on the wire.
// The Browse landing, a drilled Browse page and a fresh search all render this
// ONE component over the ambient water (the panes behind it are transparent on
// purpose, so the living water stays in view and the finished page then fades
// in over it), so a change here changes every loading state at once.
//
// The words hold still and the motion moves underneath: a swell travels along
// a row of LED cells, bright at its head with a long wake behind it, in the
// cell language the download buttons and queue rows already speak (DotBar:
// sharp cells, unlit ones left at a low glow rather than removed). A depth
// sounder's ping, which is what a page fetch is.
//
// The call sites set `active` (their own loading flag), `width` (their column),
// `tint` (root.textLo) and `onScreen` (root.onScreen); a drilled page lowers
// `topPad` under its skeleton header. Everything about the look lives here.
//
// TRANSITION. `height` follows `active` with no animation, so the finished page
// takes the hint's space the instant it is ready, while the visual itself fades
// out over the arriving content (this Item does not clip, so the fading hint
// draws past its own collapsed box). In, out and the page's own reveal are one
// cross-fade instead of a cut.
//
// MOTION BUDGET. The swell steps off ONE 20 Hz timer (`tick`) instead of a
// per-frame animation. With the wave-loop video behind it, a per-frame
// animation repaints the whole scene at the display's refresh, which is the
// trap the WaveMark logo and the LED matrices already hit (see Main.qml's
// shared ledPulse/marchTick clock). `onScreen` parks the clock when nobody can
// see it, the same gate the decorative clocks use.
