    Asynchronous Loaders incubate through the engine's controller, and the

    incubations completed back to back, ~10-16 ms each: the GUI thread's
    event loop never idled, the render loop missed its sync slot for
    hundreds of milliseconds at a stretch, and the only visible motion on
    screen (the boot water) froze with it (probe: presentation gaps up to
    356 ms mid-hold, with no single chunk crossing the 40 ms stall
