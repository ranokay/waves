# The QML/Python bridge

`WavesBridge` (backend.py) is exposed to QML as the context property
`waves`. QML calls its `@Slot`-decorated methods; the bridge answers by
emitting signals, which Main.qml consumes in one big
`Connections { target: waves }` block. Because slots run their blocking work
on thread pools and emit from worker threads, Qt delivers every signal on
the GUI thread (queued connection); QML handlers never see a race.

The signal declarations in backend.py carry inline comments with the exact
payload shapes. This file is the map of which signal belongs to which
feature.

## Session and status

| Signal                                                                 | Fires when                                                                                              |

| `confirmCategoryDlChanged`                                             | The "confirm DOWNLOAD ALL on a Browse category" preference flipped (property `confirmCategoryDl`)       |

| `forwardRequested`                                                     | The mouse forward button asks to navigate forward (the back button fires `backRequested`)               |
| `hoverMotionChanged` / `artHoverTiltChanged` / `videoHoverPeekChanged` | The matching motion preference flipped (`setWavesPref`); the surfaces re-read it                        |
| `diagnosticsExported(path)`                                            | A diagnostics export finished (`""` = failed)                                                           |
| `appleStatusChanged`                                                   | A save actually moved the `apple_enabled` switch (issue #25); Settings re-reads `appleStatus()`          |

## Search, artist pages, library

| Signal                                                     | Fires when                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `searchResults(payload)`                                   | A search or pasted-link resolve finishes; payload holds per-kind lists of plain dicts                             |
| `albumTracksLoaded(albumId, tracks)`                       | An album's ordered track list arrives (album expansion)                                                           |
| `artistLoaded(payload)`                                    | An artist page (bio, discography, top tracks) is ready                                                            |

| `libraryMore(category, items, hasMore)`                    | Next page (append, infinite scroll)                                                                               |

## Browse (editorial pages)

| Signal                          | Fires when                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `browseLoaded(payload)`         | The Browse landing page (sections + genre/mood/decade chips)                                                            |
| `browsePageLoaded(payload)`     | One drilled-into page, keyed by its TIDAL api path                                                                      |
| `browseSectionMore(payload)`    | A section's "load more" page                                                                                            |
| `browseTileArt(apiPath, urls)`  | Cover mosaic for one genre/mood/decade tile, streamed progressively                                                     |
| `browsePagePrefetched(payload)` | A hover-armed prefetch finished building a page; carries that page's art summary so the card can paint its hero at once |

`prefetchBrowseItem(kind, mediaId)` is the hover half of the same family: a
dwell on a card (or on a track row, for the album behind it) builds the page
on a worker before any click, so the open that follows is served from the page
cache. Exactly one prefetch is in flight at a time, it is dropped on a logout
generation bump, and the click that catches up to it claims the result rather
than rebuilding. It shares `_build_browse_item` with a real open, so it is not
side-effect free: that builder ends by recording the page's member track ids
(`record_members_replace`) and emitting `collectionMembershipChanged`, which
the hovered card answers by re-querying its ownership rollup. A hover
therefore costs what an open costs on that path.

`prefetchAlbumTracks(albumId)` is the album-row half: a dwell on a row fetches
that album's tracks so the expand which usually follows opens on them instead
of "Loading tracks…". Unlike its browse sibling it is silent, emitting nothing
and recording no membership (the expand does that, see `loadAlbumTracks`), and
a cached or already-in-flight album is a no-op. One unwatched fetch at a time:
a second hover while one is running is DROPPED, never queued, because the same
pool serves real clicks.

STOP partitions the queue rather than emptying it (issue #27): every row it
ends keeps its place in a Stopped section, so alongside the Failed section's
controls the queue exposes `clearStopped()` and `retryAllStopped()`, the same
shape as their Failed counterparts. `downloadPlaylistAlbums(playlistId)`
(issue #4) resolves the source album of every track on a playlist, dedupes
them, and enqueues the set under one `albums:` rollup id.

## Local library presence (the "in your library" badge)

The scan family lives in `bridge_library.py` (`LibraryMixin`, mixed into
`WavesBridge`); `waves/library_index.py` walks the configured folder and
`waves/matching.py` decides what counts as the same album.

`decide_presence` answers at two strengths and the difference matters. `present`
lights the pill and is generous. Beyond it the verdict splits into two
independent axes: `sure` is IDENTITY (a year on both sides agreeing within one,
and the title matching with its edition qualifiers intact), rendered as the
badge's "?" (dropped when proven) and the choice between a green in-library
button and the gold MAYBE; `full` is COVERAGE (a known source track count the
local copy meets), rendered as N OF M and the cyan PARTIALLY button. `full`
alone picks the button's shape (a complete copy replaces Download, however
hedged its words; a short one keeps a live button), and every claim stays
clickable and opens the gate, so a wrong match never dead-ends. `partial` False
remains the strict both-axes bar for the consumers where being wrong costs a
download outright: the bulk skip claims. The download engine never sees any of
it (pinned by `test_presence_never_reaches_the_download_engine`).

| Signal                     | Fires when                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `libraryPresenceChanged`   | The presence index (re)built or was cleared; QML re-queries `libraryAlbumPresence` |
| `libraryScanStatusChanged` | The scan's status or live progress moved; Settings re-reads `libraryScanStatus()`  |
| `librarySourceChanged`     | A library pref committed (switch, source or folder); the Settings card re-reads    |

Synchronous slots (answered from the in-memory index, no disk I/O):
`libraryAlbumPresence(artist, title, year, tracks[, duration])` (duration is
TIDAL's total seconds, the play-length identity witness),
`libraryTrackPresence(artist, title[, album, album_year[, duration]])` (the
exact-song answer behind a track's pill and its download button's claim face;
the album pair and the track's seconds are what the identity can be proven
against, and callers that omit them get `sure` False),
`artistLibraryPresence(name)`, `libraryScanStatus()`, `libraryScanProgress()`,
`librarySource()`, `libraryDownloadFolder()`,
`rescanLibrary()` (forces a full re-list) and `revealLibraryAlbum(path)`
(opens the matched folder in the file manager, resolved on a worker).

With the opt-in `library_mb_arbiter` pref on (off by default: it sends artist
and album-title search terms to musicbrainz.org), `libraryAlbumPresence` may
also overlay a MusicBrainz verdict onto an unproven answer: the lookup runs on
a worker behind a 1 req/s gate, the badge shows the unproven verdict
immediately, and `libraryPresenceChanged` re-announces when a proof lands. The
overlay can only ever upgrade `sure`; the bulk claim gate never reads it.

The whole family is gated on the `library_enabled` pref, off by default: while
it is off `_library_root()` resolves nothing and no folder is ever scanned. The
Settings card stages `library_enabled` / `library_bulk_skip` /
`library_source` / `library_folder` into the page's edit map, and SAVE CHANGES
commits them through `applySettings`, which also starts the first scan of an
enabled, configured library. `rescanLibrary()` acts only on the saved
configuration.

Bulk claim gate (`library_bulk_skip`, on by default, inert while the master
switch is off): bulk downloads leave out what the scan claims. A discography
drops fully claimed albums and guest tracks before queueing
(`_library_claims_album` / `_library_claims_track`), and a playlist's
`downloadPlaylistAlbums` (issue #4) runs the identical album-grained gate over
the albums its tracks came from; a collection job gets a
`library_claim` callable injected into the engine, consulted per track only
after the exact-id ownership gate declines and never for a merge-plan member
(`_claim_verdict`). Single-item jobs never get the callable, and
`downloadAlbumAnyway(album_id)` (the claim dialog's DOWNLOAD ANYWAY) registers
a per-album override so that click really downloads.

Both claims are strict on IDENTITY, not just presence. The track claim asks
whether a copy is already filed under the release being fetched, so the album
has to reach it: an album job passes its own release (the only place the year
is reliably spelled out), a playlist or mix lets each track name its own, and
a track with no release to name is fetched. Reading bare presence as a claim
was issue #24: a title and artist match every compilation and re-release that
share them, so tracks were dropped out of albums the user had explicitly
asked for.

## Preview and video playback

what the user clicked ("track", "artist", "album", "playlist", "mix");
non-track kinds resolve to a concrete song, reported via `previewMeta`'s
`trackId`, which is how every surface showing that song displays live
state instead of offering a restart (see `pvActive` in Main.qml).

## Internal signals (thread hops)

Signals prefixed `_` are not for QML; they marshal work back onto the GUI
thread: `_albumsQueued` (batch-enqueue a resolved discography),
`_tracksQueued` (same batch marshalling for individual tracks),
`_mediaRefetched` (re-dispatch a download whose object was evicted from the
cache), `_queueTracksFetched` (merge a track snapshot without racing live
events).

## Adding a new signal

1. Declare it with the others in backend.py, with a comment saying what it
   carries and when it fires (payloads are plain dicts/lists/strings only;
   tidalapi objects never cross the bridge).
2. Emit it from the worker; do not touch bridge state from the worker.
3. Handle it in Main.qml's `Connections { target: waves }` block
   (`function onYourSignal(args) { ... }`).
4. Add a row here.
