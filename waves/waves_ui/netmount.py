"""Remembering where a network volume came from, and mounting it back.

The recurring failure this solves: macOS quietly ejects an idle SMB volume
(sleep, lid close, a network blip), so the saved download folder's mount
point simply stops existing. Every probe the app runs then checks a path
that cannot come back on its own; navigating to the share in Finder "fixes"
it only because Finder issues a mount request served with the keychain's
saved credentials. This module gives the app that same move:

- :func:`mount_origin` asks the OS (statfs) where a mounted volume came
  from, so the app can remember "/Volumes/Media" = "smb://user@nas/Media"
  while the share is healthy.
- :func:`remount` asks macOS to mount that URL again, through the same
  NetFS framework Finder uses, with UI suppressed: keychain credentials or
  nothing. It never prompts, never blocks the caller past its timeout.

Both are macOS-only and degrade to no-ops elsewhere. Origin strings carry a
hostname and possibly a username, so callers must register them as secrets
with diagnostics before persisting; nothing in this module logs them.
