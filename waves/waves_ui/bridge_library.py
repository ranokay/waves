"""The local music-library family: scanning the user's folder, watching it for
changes, and answering "do you already have this?" from what it found.

This is the source behind the ownership badge on every album and artist. It owns
the scan lifecycle (cold scan, incremental refresh, deep sweep), the freshness
machinery that keeps a weeks-running app honest about a folder that changed
underneath it, and the in-memory presence index the badge is answered from.

The division of labour, three modules deep, each replaceable on its own:
``waves.library_index`` walks the disk and enumerates album facts;
``waves.matching`` decides whether two records name the same album; this mixin
is the Qt layer over both (threads, timers, signals, GUI-thread rules).

A mixin over WavesBridge rather than a section of backend.py: the class name,
method names and signatures deliberately mirror the redesign branch's
bridge/library.py, so when that branch lands this file resolves as a
whole-file dedupe instead of hunk surgery. This module must never import
backend.

State this family owns on the bridge (created in WavesBridge.__init__, which
stays there because it owns the object's lifecycle): ``_library`` (the
LibraryIndex store), ``_library_index`` (the presence index, or None until a scan
finishes), its ``_library_track_index`` twin and ``_library_artist_index``
rollup, ``_library_scan_status``,
``_library_index_building`` / ``_library_index_pending``, ``_library_gen``, the
watcher and its debounce/pending-add state, and the scan timers.

THREADING (the rule this family exists to respect): scans run on a worker pool,
but the QFileSystemWatcher and every timer live on the GUI thread. Worker results
cross back over ``_librarySyncWatch`` / ``_libraryPollDone``, never by touching
watcher state directly.
