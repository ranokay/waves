"""The local music-library family: scanning the user's folder, watching it for
changes, and answering "do you already have this?" from what it found.

This is the source behind the ownership badge on every album and artist. It owns
the scan lifecycle (cold scan, incremental refresh, deep sweep), the freshness
machinery that keeps a weeks-running app honest about a folder that changed
underneath it, and the in-memory presence index the badge is answered from.

The division of labour, three modules deep, each replaceable on its own:
``waves.library_index`` walks the disk and enumerates album facts;
``waves.matching`` decides whether two records name the same album; this mixin
is the Qt layer over both (threads, timers, signals, GUI-thread rules).

A mixin over WavesBridge rather than a section of backend.py: the class name,
method names and signatures deliberately mirror the redesign branch's
bridge/library.py, so when that branch lands this file resolves as a
whole-file dedupe instead of hunk surgery. This module must never import
backend.

State this family owns on the bridge (created in WavesBridge.__init__, which
stays there because it owns the object's lifecycle): ``_library`` (the
LibraryIndex store), ``_library_index`` (the presence index, or None until a scan
finishes), its ``_library_track_index`` twin and ``_library_artist_index``
rollup, ``_library_scan_status``,
``_library_index_building`` / ``_library_index_pending``, ``_library_gen``, the
watcher and its debounce/pending-add state, and the scan timers.

THREADING (the rule this family exists to respect): scans run on a worker pool,
but the QFileSystemWatcher and every timer live on the GUI thread. Worker results
cross back over ``_librarySyncWatch`` / ``_libraryPollDone``, never by touching
watcher state directly.

        re-release that share them, so "you own this song somewhere" was
        skipping tracks out of an album the user had explicitly asked for: the
        folder landed short and nothing on screen said which tracks were
        missing. The album this track belongs to is what makes the question
        answerable, so it is passed in and the proven axis is required.

        Same bar, same reasoning as _library_claims_album: a wrong skip costs
        the user a track they never find out was missing, so it may not
        happen on a guess."""

    # ---- Probe by name: what an untrusted listing hides -------------------------

    # page of artist folders over and over (see library_index._scandir_one),
    # so the walk never sees the artists past it, and every badge and every
    # gate read "not in library" for a library the user owns: duplicates were
    # downloaded on that answer. The scan flags such a listing, and from then
    # on a MISS for an artist the index has never seen is answered by asking
    # the disk directly, by name, in the spellings the naming settings would
    # write (LibraryIndex.probe_folders). A hit indexes that artist's subtree
    # and republishes a NEW index object, so every surface (both pills, the
    # artist badge, the four gates) flips without a rescan and every memo
    # keyed on the index resets. Healthy libraries never enter this path: the
    # flag is the gate, so they pay nothing. The memo and in-flight set are
    # touched from the GUI thread (pill asks) and pool threads (the job's
    # finally, the gates); each touch is one dict or set operation, and the
