"""Local record of what has actually been downloaded, so Waves can answer "do
you already have this track, and at what quality" from reality rather than
from a download ledger.

The rule this store lives by: it DESCRIBES what was downloaded (the actual
final on-disk path and the delivered quality, keyed by the track's namespaced
id, "tidal:123" -- a bare id reads as tidal, the spelling every pre-namespace
caller used); it never DECIDES ownership on its own. Ownership is answered
live, by re-checking whether a recorded path still exists on disk right now,
so a file the user deleted and wants again is offered for re-download with no
clearing step. A ledger that just says "downloaded before" would lie the
moment a file is deleted; re-checking the filesystem every time is what keeps
it honest.

Pure standard library (sqlite3), with no Qt and no tidalapi import, so it unit
tests without the GUI stack and never couples the download engine to the UI.
