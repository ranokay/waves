    Its message is written for the user and carries nothing but counts and
    plain words, which is what makes it the one download failure the queue row
    may repeat verbatim: any other exception can spell out a path, a URL or a
    host, and the queue is on screen. See the queue row's failure reason.

    A RuntimeError so it stays the exception this has always been to everyone
    who only needs to know that the download failed; the class is there for
    the one caller that needs to know the message is safe to show.
