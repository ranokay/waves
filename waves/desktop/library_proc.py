"""The app's side of the library scanner process (waves.library.worker).

One long-lived child, spawned on the first job and kept for the session,
runs the scan and the by-name probes so they never hold the app's
interpreter. Jobs are sequential: the bridge's scan machinery already
serialises them (one scan at a time, one probe drainer). Cancel is a kill:
the child keeps no state between jobs, and the cache is a WAL sqlite file
that a killed writer leaves consistent.

Failure is never fatal: a child that cannot be spawned, or that dies twice,
hands the job back and the bridge runs it in-process exactly as before,
once at INFO.
