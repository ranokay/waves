"""In-app self-updater for Waves.

Waves ships as a packaged single-file binary built by CI and published to a
public GitHub repo's Releases. This module lets the app notice a newer release,
download the build for the current OS/arch, verify it against its ``.sha256``
sidecar, and swap it in atomically, the same shape as the FFmpeg manager
(:mod:`waves.desktop.ffmpeg_manager`), which this deliberately mirrors.

Nothing here touches Qt, so it is pure and unit-testable; the Qt slots/signals
that drive the Settings UI live in :mod:`waves.desktop.backend`.

Design rules baked in here:

* **Opt-in, no telemetry.** This module only ever issues a plain ``GET`` to the
  GitHub Releases API and to a release asset URL. It sends no user data. The
  *automatic* check is gated by a user preference in the backend; nothing here
  runs on a schedule by itself.
* **No-op until configured.** When :data:`REPO` is blank, every entry point
  degrades to a safe no-op (``status()`` reports ``not_configured`` and no
  network call is made). It is set to the public Waves repo, so a packaged
  build can find its releases; the automatic check still stays gated behind the
  user preference (see above).
* **Check anywhere, install only when frozen.** The version check works from a
  source checkout too (so a dev is told a newer release exists), but a real
  self-install only runs from a packaged/frozen build; from source the UI sends
  the user to the Releases page instead.
* **Defer to a managing package manager.** An install owned by Homebrew, Scoop,
  Snap, Flatpak or an AppImage (see :func:`managed_channel`) still gets update
  *notices*, but the self-installer stands down so the two update paths never
  fight over the same files; the UI points at the manager's upgrade command.
  External updater tools that replace the app bundle themselves keep working
  either way, nothing here locks the install.

        directory, so a detached helper waits for this process to exit, then swaps
        the new tree in for the install directory and relaunches.

        The new tree is landed on the install volume HERE, while the app is
        still running, so all the helper has to do is two same-volume directory
        renames. A robocopy of the whole tree (hundreds of megabytes, tens of
        seconds) would run at the one moment that is most likely to be a
        Windows shutdown: the app exiting. A shutdown kills the mirror halfway
        and leaves the install broken with the only good copy stranded at
        ``.old``, unrepaired and unrepairable except by hand. Two renames leave
        a window
        measured in the gap between them.

        Crash-safe: the helper renames the live install to ``.old`` first (a
        fast same-volume move), renames the new tree into its place, and
        deletes the backup ONLY once the swapped-in folder holds the
        executable. A failed rename, or one that left no executable, restores
        ``.old``, so no outcome leaves the user without a working copy. If even
        the initial backup rename fails, the live install is untouched and
        simply relaunched. The staged tree is checked for the executable before
        the helper is even written, and while the app is still running the
        helper only waits, it never starts a second instance.

        The backup holds the whole OLD install folder, including anything the
        user kept in there that the build never shipped (a download folder
        pointed inside it, a zip extracted over a folder that already held
        other files). Waves never deletes a user's files, so before the backup
        is discarded a robocopy moves back everything the new tree does not
        have (``/XC /XN /XO`` leave only the files missing from the swapped-in
        install), and a failure there keeps the backup folder rather than
        deleting it, marked (see :func:`_mark_kept`) so that neither a later
        update nor a later helper can take that name for a backup slot of its
        own and delete the folder to make room.

        The script itself is pure ASCII and every path reaches it as an
        argument. cmd.exe decodes a .bat in the console's OEM code page, so a
        UTF-8 helper with, say, a Cyrillic account name interpolated into it
        decodes as mojibake: the first `if not exist` tests a path that cannot
        exist, the helper concludes there is nothing to apply, and every update
        silently does nothing while the UI says it worked. Arguments arrive
        through the command line, which is UTF-16 all the way, so they are
        immune to that; the same is true of the `%` a batch file
        would otherwise expand out of a path. Only the app's own paths are
        passed (never the asset name), so there is no command injection.
        The per-OS swap is only fully verifiable against a real packaged build.
