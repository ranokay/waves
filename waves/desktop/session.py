Subclasses the engine's ``waves.config.Tidal`` so a correctness fix lands here
instead of in the shared ``config.py`` method body. Keeping the override out of
``config.py`` follows the engine/UI seam discipline: engine modules stay close
to their inherited shape (a habit from the fork era's upstream merges, kept
because it makes the engine easy to audit), and UI-owned behavior lives here.

    Upstream ``login_token`` deletes the saved sign-in on *any* exception, so a
    black-holed network, a 429, a 502 or a captive portal at launch logs the
    user out permanently: the OAuth refresh credential is gone and cannot be
    recovered. This override deletes only when TIDAL positively refused the
    sign-in, and keeps it in every other case.

    The asymmetry is the whole argument. Keeping a sign-in that really is dead
    costs nothing: the user signs in again and ``save()`` atomically replaces the
    file. Deleting a live one cannot be undone.

    The same asymmetry rules out ever deleting during a client probe. Fetching
    Dolby Atmos swaps the client id and re-authenticates mid-download to prove
    the swap took, and that goes through this very method. A refusal there is
    the Atmos client being turned away, which says nothing about the user's own
    sign-in, yet deleting the credential there strands a running queue while the
    window still says signed in. It reaches this method through
    ``_reauthenticate_current_client``, so the probe is marked there.
