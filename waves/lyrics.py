"""LRCLIB lyrics lookup.

TIDAL serves machine-transcribed lyrics for tracks whose IDs have no
human-submitted text yet (recent re-recordings and reissues especially), and
those transcriptions are often garbled. LRCLIB (lrclib.net, the community
database behind LRCGet) carries human-submitted synced lyrics, so it is tried
first when the preference is on; TIDAL's own lyrics stay as the fallback.

The lookup is two requests at most: the exact-signature endpoint (artist,
title, album, duration), then one search filtered by duration. Any miss or
network problem returns empty strings so the caller falls through to TIDAL;
this module never raises.
