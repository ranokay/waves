"""The matching brain: how Waves decides that two records name the same music.

Every "do I already have this?" question is answered here, and only here: the
library badge compares a TIDAL album against the folders scanned out of the
user's own music library, and both sides are reduced to the same normalised
strings before anything is compared.

The rule this module lives by: it matches STRINGS and plain dicts, never a
catalog's objects. A caller pulls a title, an artist name, a year and a track
count out of whatever it holds (a tidalapi album, a row of scanned tags) and
asks a question here; the answers never depend on where the facts came from.
That is what lets the library index, the GUI bridge and a future second source
share one definition of "the same album" instead of drifting into three.

Pure standard library, with no Qt and no tidalapi import, so it unit tests
without the GUI stack (the same property that makes ownership.py and
library_index.py testable, and the reason the bridge keeps only the small
object-to-strings adapters that feed this).

Two biases run through the whole module, and both are deliberate:

* **Canonicalise, never guess.** Cross-catalog comparison folds punctuation the
  two catalogs tag differently for the same release, symmetrically on both
  sides, so it can only ever fix a spurious mismatch. There is no fuzzy
  distance anywhere: a match is exact on normalised text.
* **When unsure, keep both.** A missed match costs a badge. A wrong match tells
  the user they own a record they do not. So every decision here fails towards
  the harmless side, and towards showing nothing.

# verbatim compare fails every cross-spelling, so a copy that IS the edition
# on screen could never be proven whenever the two catalogs dressed it
# differently.

# years, and only for vocabulary it knows. Synonyms collapse INSIDE a class
# (filler words like "edition"/"version" carry no meaning and drop out);
# classes never collapse into each other ({deluxe} != {super, deluxe} !=
# {expanded}, and acoustic/live/instrumental never equal the studio cut). A
# tail containing ANY word it does not know is not an edition tail at all and
# stays a literal part of the title, which is what keeps "Untitled (Black Is)"
# and "Untitled (Rise)" apart: recognition can only fold spellings of the same
# thing, never two different things.

    Returns ``{present, sure, local_album_id}`` plus the ``local_*`` quality
    readout of the best copy.

    There is no completeness bar here because there is nothing to complete: a
    track is either on disk or not. ``present`` is therefore the loosest thing
    this module reports, and it is deliberately so: it answers "a song by this
    name and artist is somewhere in your library", which is what a hedged pill
    wants to say. It is NOT an answer to "you already have this album's copy",
    and no caller may read it as one. Still refused: an empty artist (a
    title-only key matches any local song that shares the title) and
    Various-Artists credits, same as albums.

    ``sure`` is that stricter question, and the IDENTITY axis the album verdict
    reports: the copy sits in the release the caller named. A track carries no
    year of its own and its title plus artist match every edition, compilation
    and re-recording that share them, so the holding folder is the only
    evidence there is. When the caller names the album the track belongs to
    (``album``/``album_year``), a candidate whose folder agrees on both
    (edition-qualified title, years within one) proves the match. Callers that
    name no album get sure False, which is the safe direction.

    The file's own play length only ever REFUTES. A copy minutes from the
    track on screen is a different recording wearing the same name, whatever
    its folder says, so ``duration`` (TIDAL's seconds) can throw a candidate
    out. It cannot vouch for one: seconds prove a RECORDING, and every
    compilation, best-of and re-release carries the same recording to the
    second. Letting length prove alone is what made a copy filed under one
    album answer for another (issue #24): the pill went green on a compilation
    whose tracks were nowhere on disk, and the bulk claim gate, which rides
    this axis, skipped them out of an album the user had explicitly asked for.

    Candidate choice follows that proof rather than fighting it: among copies
    whose folder agrees, the best quality wins; only when none agrees does the
    best copy overall answer, unproven. Otherwise a stray high-bitrate single
    would outrank the album copy sitting right there and report the whole
    match unproven."""
