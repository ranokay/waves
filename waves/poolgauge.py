"""A QThreadPool-shaped saturation gauge for plain ThreadPoolExecutors.

The diagnostics perf sampler reads ``activeThreadCount`` / ``maxThreadCount``
off every pool it is given, and the project convention is that a new pool
registers so its saturation shows up in a verbose report. Executors that are
built and torn down per job (the scanner's walk/read pools, the download
engine's segment and per-item fan-outs, the search enrich burst, the
bridge's per-call fan-outs for search popularity and merged-album tracks)
cannot be handed over directly: they are ThreadPoolExecutors (no such
methods) and a registered reference would go stale. A gauge counts work items in flight
instead, which is what saturation actually means there, and reads zero
between jobs. One module-level gauge per pool kind, registered once at
startup in backend.py beside the QThreadPools.

Grew out of the scanner's private gauge (waves/library_index.py), promoted
here so the engine can use it without importing the scanner, and the scanner
without importing the engine. Deliberately Qt-free: the download engine
imports this and must stay importable without PySide6.

Counts only integers. Nothing about the user's library, downloads or their
names passes through here.
