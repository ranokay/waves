        A sustained run of catalog calls is what TIDAL answers with a 429, and

        lookup plus a playback request, so a 500-track playlist asks some 1500
        questions in a row where an album asks 30. The two settings that say
        so were shipped as Advanced fields and read by nothing at all, so a
        user meeting rate limits could turn them and change nothing
        (issue #35).

        The pause belongs to the item, taken by the worker that picked it up:
        a thread pool has no batch boundary of its own, and this is the moment
        the item's own API traffic begins. A list shorter than one batch never
        pauses, and neither does a single-item download.

        Every OTHER worker stands back with it. One worker sleeping while its
        siblings carry on is not a pause at all: with the default three, the
        rate dropped by about a third where the setting says the app pauses.

        Two pauses can be in force at once (a batch smaller than the worker
        count puts a second worker on a boundary while the first is still
        standing back), so they are counted and the run resumes when the LAST
        of them is over, never when the first one happens to wake. The worker
        that took a pause is bound by that too: it waits the others out on its
        way back, or the promise held everybody except the one who made it.

        The pause is logged at INFO, so it reaches the breadcrumb ring and a
        support bundle rather than a verbose run only. It is a deliberate
        multi-second stall of the only running job, which is exactly what a
        user reports as "long playlists hang periodically": with nothing
        naming the throttle, the trail shows silent gaps between items and
        reads like a network fault. It fires once per batch, twenty-five times

        ``probes`` is the same list of spellings (same order, preferred first)

        would look missing, download again, and the user would own two
        folders for one album. Nothing already on disk may move or be
        duplicated, so an old spelling wins wherever it exists.

        ``older`` lists the spellings previous behavior produced, most recent

        plain-removal spelling and then the pre-0.1.17 one, so switching the

        Folder and file are decided separately, so an existing album keeps its

        title) were silently skipped after the first one downloaded (issue
        #15). Downloads tag each file with the TIDAL item id (read_item_id);
        when the name is taken, the ids decide:

        - untagged occupant (a pre-id library, or a raw .ts video): identity
          unknown, keep the historical skip so re-downloading an old library
          cannot duplicate it wholesale;
        - occupant has this item's id: already downloaded, skip;
        - different id: look through EVERY one of the name's uniquify variants
          (stem_NN) that exists, gaps in the numbering included, since a user
          who removed stem_01 kept stem_02 where it was. This item's id there
          means skip; an untagged variant means identity unknown and skips too,
          the same answer the base occupant gets (read_item_id's contract: a
          missing id is never evidence of a DIFFERENT item). Only when every
          existing variant is tagged with some other id is this a NEW colliding
          track the caller downloads (the final move uniquifies it).

        The answer is the PATH holding the item, not a bare yes: when the item
        sits at a numbered variant, a yes alone left the caller acting on the
        base name, so the symlink and the returned track path pointed at the
        colliding stranger's file. Variant names are spelled through the same
        trimming that wrote them (a stem at the 255-byte cap gives up bytes to
        the _NN suffix, so the raw concatenation is a name that cannot exist),
        and a 0-byte variant is an interrupted write, not evidence: judging it
        identity-unknown skipped the track for good, the exact trap
        check_file_exists already refuses on the base name.

        One listing of the directory, not up to 99 stats: on a network mount
        that difference is felt per track. Names are matched literally, never
        globbed, because a stem may hold glob characters of its own.

        check, because the folder was still empty when each of them looked and

        this item" for a file whose id it cannot read, which is the right

        a DIFFERENT item, and skipping is the safe side there. It is the wrong
        answer HERE. At this point the bytes are already fetched and the only
        question is whether this run has itself just landed them, so an

        video writes no tag atoms). Both read as a stranger there, and the
        second occurrence wrote the byte-identical copy this guard exists to
        prevent. So the run's OWN ledger of names written is asked first: it is

        ``items()`` over an explicit track list (the best-of-both merge in the
        Waves bridge): an album gets its playlist file the same way however its
        tracks were sourced. Kept as one method so the two cannot drift on what
        the file is called, whether it sorts by number, or what it lists.

        The reported paths carry the list's own track order, so the m3u plays
        back in TIDAL's order (issue #22); the directory set alone cannot say
        which track comes first. They are also the m3u's CONTENTS, skipped
        tracks included: re-downloading an album whose songs are already there
        must still list the whole album, not just the one song that was
        missing. What they are NOT is the writer's SCOPE. Writing the playlist
        REPLACES the file a directory already holds, so the directories are
        narrowed to the ones this run actually put a file into
        (_dirs_this_run_filled); a run that skipped everything writes nothing
