"""The library scanner as its own process.

The scan of the music folder (the directory walk, the tag reads, the sqlite
writes, the by-name probes of an untrusted share and its fresh-mount relist)
must not run on the app's own pool threads: those threads share one
interpreter with the GUI thread, and every QML binding that reaches the
bridge, every queued signal and every timer slot waits its turn for it
behind the walk, so the launch window drops frames for the whole sweep.
Deferring the sweep until after the launch look only moves the stutter later.

Here the scan runs in a child process with an interpreter of its own. The
app's process only ever READS the cache (see LibraryIndex.presence_facts);
this process is the one writer. The two talk over pipes, one JSON object per
line:

  in  {"op": "scan", "id": N, "cache": PATH, "root": DIR, "force_full": B,
       "root_is_local": B|null, "config_dir": DIR, "recover": B, "lock_wait": S}
      {"op": "probe", "id": N, "cache": PATH, "root": DIR, "names": [..],
       "spellings": {name: [..]}}
      {"op": "quit"}
  out {"ev": "ready"}
      {"ev": "progress", "id": N, "event": {..}}     the scanner's own sink
      {"ev": "done", "id": N, "count": C, "status": S, "partial": B,
       "shape": [held, distinct], "reconciled": B, "recovered": R}
      {"ev": "probe_done", "id": N, "found": C|null}
      {"ev": "error", "id": N, "message": M}
      {"ev": "log", "level": L, "name": LOGGER, "msg": M}

The parent kills this process to cancel a job (a library folder change), so
a job never has to poll for supersession; EOF on stdin (the parent gone)
ends it. Nothing here imports Qt: the entry points check for
``--library-worker`` before the app's own imports (waves.py, desktop's
__main__), and the source launcher is ``python -m waves.library.worker``.

Only protocol goes to the real stdout. sys.stdout is pointed at stderr as
the first thing, so a stray print anywhere below cannot corrupt the stream.
