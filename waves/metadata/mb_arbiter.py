"""MusicBrainz arbitration for library matches the scan cannot prove.

The presence matcher proves identity from what the user's files can say:
years, edition-qualified titles, counts and play lengths. When neither side
can testify (an undated folder beside a release TIDAL reports no length for),
the pill wears its "?" forever. MusicBrainz knows the missing facts: every
edition of a release, each with its date, its track count and its recordings'
lengths, on CC0 data. This module asks, compares, and answers strictly
True (proven), False (asked and not provable) or None (could not ask, try
again later).

The proof rule is deliberately conservative, in the matcher's own currency:
among MusicBrainz's releases of (artist, title), find one whose edition-
qualified title matches (same_edition), whose track count equals the LOCAL
copy's, and whose total length matches the LOCAL copy's summed seconds within
the matcher's own album tolerance. That names the local copy's edition. It
proves the match only when that same release also agrees with the release ON
SCREEN on every axis TIDAL offered (track count when given, year within one
when given, total length within the same tolerance when given). Nothing
looser: a lookup that cannot pin BOTH sides to one MusicBrainz release proves
nothing.

Politeness and privacy follow the genre resolver that shipped on the harbor
branch: a process-wide one-request-per-second gate, a descriptive User-Agent
(MusicBrainz blocks anonymous clients), definite-only caching in a local
sqlite file (a transient network error is never cached, so a blip cannot
poison an album forever), and a short negative TTL for definitive not-founds.
Requests carry artist and release-title search terms, service data and
user-chosen text, never an account id, token or local path; log lines carry
outcomes and counts only.

Pure standard library (urllib, json, sqlite3), no Qt and no tidalapi, so it
unit tests without the GUI stack. The HTTP layer is one injectable ``fetch``
callable returning ``(status, body)`` tuples, so tests drive the whole
arbiter with canned responses and never touch the network or sleep.
