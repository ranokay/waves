# Dolby Atmos client id (obfuscated). This is a public, first-party TIDAL app

# TIDAL only serves Atmos manifests to a client it still honours, and the
# previous id here was revoked (every playback request answered 401/subStatus
# 4005), which is why Atmos-only tracks silently landed as the stereo AAC 320
# fallback. This id still delivers real Atmos (verified end to end: eac3, 5.1,
# 768 kbps) and needs NO secret: TIDAL accepts the refresh with an empty
# secret, so the only value shipped is this public id. Expect TIDAL to rotate
# it eventually; a fresh working id surfaces in the streamrip / OrpheusDL /
# tiddl issue trackers when it does.
