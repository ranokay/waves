"""TIDAL playlist-folder tree: sweep and {folder_path} template handling.

The v2 folder endpoints only ever return one level at a time, and tidalapi's
parsed objects cannot be trusted for tree structure (Folder.parent_folder_id
is never set by parse() and stays at the constructor default "root"), so the
walk tracks parent paths itself. Playlist objects carry no folder reference at
all: the id-to-path map built here is the only source of folder attribution,
including for playlists downloaded individually.

Everything in this module is bridge-independent on purpose so it applies
unchanged to any backend layout.
