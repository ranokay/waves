"""Waves-owned DASH manifest arithmetic.

tidalapi's ``DashInfo.get_urls`` derives the segment URL count from the MPD
SegmentTimeline as ``2 + sum(r if r else 1)``: one for the init segment, one
for "the very first media segment", then the repeat counts. Per the DASH spec
an ``<S r="N">`` element describes ``N + 1`` segments (r is the number of
*additional* repeats), so the correct count is ``1 + sum(r + 1)``. The two
formulas differ by ``1 - (number of S elements with r > 0)``:

* a typical track (one repeated S plus one short final S): difference 0,
  every generated URL is real audio;
* a very short track (a single S with r=0): difference +1, tidalapi emits one
  URL past the end of the audio. Requesting it returns HTTP 500. This is the
  "spurious tail" the download loop has historically tolerated;
* two or more repeated S elements: difference negative, tidalapi emits too
  FEW URLs and the download is missing audio regardless of segment failures.

Re-deriving the correct count from the manifest turns the download loop's
blanket last-segment leniency into an exact decision: a failed final segment
is harmless if and only if it is over-generated padding.

This lives with the TIDAL provider rather than in ``download.py``: the engine
module keeps its inherited shape, and the provider seam is where TIDAL's
manifest quirks are understood.
