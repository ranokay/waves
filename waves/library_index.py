"""Local music-library index: answers "do I already have this album, and how
many of its tracks" from the user's own files on disk.

This is what lets the ownership badge recognise a whole library, not only what
Waves downloaded. It walks a configured library folder, treats every directory
that directly holds audio files as an album, reads that album's identity from
the TAGS of one representative file (album / album-artist / date), and counts
the audio files for the track total. The raw per-album facts are cached in a
small sqlite file so a relaunch is a cheap stat sweep instead of a full re-scan.

It never DECIDES ownership matching itself: it just enumerates album facts. The
caller feeds those facts to ``waves.matching``, which is where every "is this
the same album?" question in the app is answered, so the matching brain stays
in one place.

Nothing here reads album art or serves a browsable view of the library: the
index exists to answer "do I have this", and one file open per album folder is
the whole cost of a scan.

Identity comes from tags, never the folder name: the download path is lossily
sanitised on write (a "?" or "/" in a title is dropped), so the folder cannot be
trusted to reconstruct the real album/artist strings. Tags hold the truth.

Pure standard library plus mutagen for tag reads, with no Qt and no tidalapi, so
it unit tests without the GUI stack.

        album folders now indexed.

        Discovery is INCREMENTAL and RESUMABLE (see the ``dirs`` table): a warm
        relaunch re-lists only folders whose mtime changed, and a scan killed
        mid-walk resumes from its last checkpoint instead of re-crawling the whole
        tree. Only album folders whose mtime (or audio-file count) changed since
        last time are re-read, so a warm relaunch is a stat sweep. Folders that
        vanished are pruned. If ``root`` is missing or unreadable the cache is left
        untouched (a temporarily-offline NAS must not wipe every badge).
        ``should_continue`` is polled so a superseded scan (library-folder change,
        shutdown) can bail without corrupting the cache. ``last_scan_status``
        records why a scan found nothing, so the UI can tell an empty library from
        a folder it cannot read. ``force_full`` re-lists every folder regardless of
        the mtime cache (still re-reading only changed albums): the manual Rescan
        uses it as a catch-all for anything the incremental sweep could miss, such
        as a network mount that fails to bump a folder's mtime on a change.

        ``on_progress`` receives a dict describing the scan as it advances, so the
        UI can show live progress, an ETA and the album under the needle instead
        of a bare spinner: ``{"phase": "walk", "found": n, "checked": c}`` while
        album folders are being discovered ("checked" counts directory listings,
        the number that moves even while breadth-first exploration has not yet
        reached album depth), then ``{"phase": "read", "done": d, "total": t,
        "indexed": c, "artist": a, "album": b, "committed": bool}`` as tags are
        read ("committed" marks a database flush, so the caller knows when the
        partial results are queryable). Events are rate-limited to one per
        ``progress_interval`` seconds (milestones always emit), so a live count
        costs a handful of callbacks per second regardless of library size. A
        COLD scan of a big library on a NAS is latency-bound in BOTH phases (one
        directory listing per folder, then one tag read per album, each a network
        round trip), so both the walk and the reads run on small thread pools;
        this and the progress events keep a first scan of thousands of albums in
        minutes, with badges lighting up while it runs instead of only at the end.

        ``root_is_local`` sizes those pools: False (the caller classified the
        root as a network mount, see the bridge's _library_root_is_local) drops
        both to _NETWORK_WORKERS so the scan never becomes the herd that wedges

        folder whose albums the cache already holds unchanged still counts:
        rows were written for it, so the caller must republish either way.

        ``names`` is a BATCH on purpose. One call takes the cache lock once,
        reads the directory tree once and writes once, so asking about a whole
        page of search results costs barely more than asking about one artist.
        Asking one name at a time is the expensive way round, and it also loses
        races: every other caller gets None back while the first holds the lock.

        The walk can only index what a listing names. A network share whose
        directory paging is broken names the same first page over and over, so
        a whole artist can be absent from every listing while
        ``os.stat(root/Artist)`` finds it at once, with its albums listing
        perfectly (they are small folders). Every badge and every download
        gate has the artist's name in hand, so for a folder flagged untrusted
        the name is tried directly, in the spellings ``candidates`` returns
        (the caller derives them from the download naming settings; this
        module does not import them). One stat per spelling, nothing listed
        at the untrusted level; on a hit the subtree walks and reads exactly as
        the scan would have, stamped with the CURRENT generation and written
        under the untrusted folder as parent, which is what keeps it alive: the
        next walk re-queues that folder's stored children instead of trusting
        its listing, and re-stamps them (see _walk_album_dirs). No prune here;
        only a completed walk prunes.

        Refused (0, nothing written) unless the cache was scanned for this very
        root: a probe must never stamp rows into a tree that belongs to another
        folder, or to no scan at all. A spelling that only differs by case or
        normalisation from a stored child is skipped, so a folder is never
        indexed twice under two spellings. Layouts without an artist folder
        (albums straight under the root) gain nothing here; the warning in
        Settings says so in plain words.

        ``on_progress`` takes the same events refresh() sends, so a probe that
        has hundreds of folders to read (a whole share's worth of recovered
        artists, minutes over a network) moves the same bar the scan moved
        instead of leaving it parked on the scan's last count. The walk events
        count across every folder found so far, so the numbers only climb.

        if the folder is known and its mtime is unchanged, the listing is REUSED

        the folder is scandir'd, its row and any newly discovered child rows are
        written, and an album candidate ``(dirpath, first_audio, mtime,
        count)`` is collected if it holds audio. Every visited folder is stamped ``gen`` so the
        caller can prune whatever was not seen. Directory rows are flushed in
        checkpoints, so a scan killed mid-walk resumes rather than restarting.

        All database access is on this thread; workers only touch the filesystem.
        Completions arrive via a queue (O(1) per folder), not a rescan of the
        pending set, so a huge tree does not peg a core. Returns the album
        candidates that need consideration, or None if superseded mid-walk (the

        different: it still yields its codec (from the stream), its row
        persists, and honestly never matches anything.

        because the folder is proven mixed and they could be anything). The majority must be overwhelming (a single
        dissenter, or nine agreeing files in ten) AND the representative must
        be on the majority's side, or the count is zeroed as before: an
        "Inbox" dump whose first file says "Discovery" must not index as a
        full Discovery. Any disagreement at all silences the folder's declared
        shape and its runtime, because a sum over mixed contents is exactly
        the undercount/overcount those witnesses must never carry. Unreadable
        or untagged files never count as disagreement, and never cost a track
        row beyond their own: only positive evidence rejects.

        §8.4 (issue #36): an Atmos Version is never a second canonical entry. Every

        arithmetic, the majority vote, the declared shape and the runtime all

        whose title matches a canonical sibling attaches to that track --
        kept as a per-track row (so the track pill still sees it) but never
        counted. An Atmos file with no canonical twin is an atmos-only track
        and stays its own canonical entry. A file whose type could not be
        read at all stays canonical: dropping it would undercount on a
        transient hiccup. ``has_atmos`` reports whether Atmos Versions sit
