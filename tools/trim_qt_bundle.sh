# trim_qt_bundle.sh: strip Qt modules Waves never loads from a built bundle.
#
# Nuitka's PySide6 plugin copies the *entire* qml/ module tree (and every Qt
# library it links) into the standalone build. Waves is a small QtQuick app: it
# only imports QtQuick(.Controls.Basic / .Layouts / .Effects / .Shapes /
# .Dialogs) and QtCore, so the vast majority is dead weight, led by a ~210 MB
# bundled Chromium (QtWebEngineCore). Removing unreferenced modules is safe:
# nothing imports them, so nothing loads them.
#
# Works on all three packaged layouts; pass the bundle ROOT:
#   macOS:    dist/waves.app        (libs live under Contents/MacOS, bare names)
#   Linux:    dist/waves.dist       (libQt6Foo.so.6)
#   Windows:  dist/waves.dist       (Qt6Foo.dll)
# Qt library names differ per OS, so module matching is by SUBSTRING, which makes
# the one token list work everywhere. macOS is the only layout verified locally;
# the Linux/Windows legs are exercised on CI.

# SUBSTRING tokens for the top-level Qt *library* files to remove. Matched as

# (libQt6WebEngineCore.so.6) and Windows (Qt6WebEngineCore.dll). "3D" also
# matches QtQuick3D*; "Widgets" matches both QtWidgets and QtOpenGLWidgets.
#
# HARD INVARIANT: never match the bare QtOpenGL library. QtQuick hard-links it on
# every OS even on the Metal/D3D RHI backend, so removing it makes the core
# libqtquick2plugin fail to load and the app dies at launch. There is NO "OpenGL"
# token below, and the keep-guard in remove_libs() refuses any *OpenGL* file that
# is not *OpenGLWidgets*.
#
# "Multimedia" is intentionally absent so the QtMultimedia library survives; the
# "Widgets" token below still removes the unused QtMultimediaWidgets.
# ShaderTools: nothing in the bundle links it (QtQuick.Effects ships pre-baked
# shaders inside QtQuickEffects; verified by an otool -L reverse scan of every
# Mach-O). Svg: only pulled by the unused VectorImage/svg-icon chain, all of
# which goes too: the QML dir above, the QuickVectorImage libraries via their
# token, and the svg imageformat/iconengine plugins below.
# The Labs* tokens name each library individually; never add a bare "Labs"
# token, QtLabsSettings must survive (QtCore's Settings {} in Main.qml).
# unicodedata.so is NOT dead weight and must never be listed here: idna (a
# requests dependency in the bundle) imports unicodedata at module scope.
