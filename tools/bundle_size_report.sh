# build log, local or CI, carries the same table and a size regression is
# visible by diffing two logs. Plain text, stable sort, sizes in MB.

# pipeline, which `set -e` turns into a failed build. Nothing was wrong with
# the bundle, it had just grown enough top-level entries to fill 64 KB of du
# output. awk reads to the end, so no producer is ever cut off.
