"""Remove QML modules from the BUILD VIRTUALENV that ship only a static library.

Qt 6.11 added ``Qt.labs.assetdownloader``, whose plugin exists only as
``libqmlassetdownloaderprivateplugin.a`` (``.lib`` on Windows) with no shared
object beside it. Nuitka treats every plugin under ``qml/`` as loadable and
dies trying to resolve the archive, differently on each platform:

    Linux    FATAL ... patchelf: not an ELF executable
    macOS    FATAL ... failed to find path ...(mocs_compilation.cpp.o)
    Windows  Nuitka-Inclusion:WARNING ... TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable

``--noinclude-dlls`` does not reach it (the file arrives through the pyside6
plugin's qml scan, not the DLL list) and ``--noinclude-qt-plugins`` only takes
family names such as "qml", which the app needs. So the module is pruned here,
before Nuitka walks the tree.

The rule is generic rather than a name match, so the next static-only module Qt
adds is handled too: a directory qualifies only when it holds a static plugin
library AND no shared one, which means Qt shipped nothing loadable there. A
module Waves actually imports would carry a shared library and be kept.

Only the build virtualenv's PySide6 tree is touched. Run it with the same
interpreter that will run Nuitka.
