"""Generate the Ed25519 release-signing keypair for the Waves self-updater.

Run this once, offline, before the first signed release. It prints two things:

  * ``UPDATE_PUBLIC_KEY = "..."``: paste into ``waves/desktop/signing.py`` so
    every shipped binary can verify update manifests.
  * a PKCS#8 PEM private key: store verbatim as the GitHub Actions secret
    ``WAVES_SIGNING_KEY`` and never commit it. Anyone with this key can sign
    updates the app will trust, so treat it like a root credential.

Usage::

    uv run --locked --all-extras python tools/waves_release_keygen.py
